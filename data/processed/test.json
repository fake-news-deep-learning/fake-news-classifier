    "text": "Washington, DC - Today, U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) spoke on the floor of the United States Senate about the Marriage Protection Amendment. The following is the text of his statement as prepared and submitted for the record: Mr. President, I believe that the institution of marriage can serve its public purposes only when it is understood as being a union between one man and one woman. It is this understanding that offers public reinforcement to the vital and unique roles played by mothers and fathers in the raising of their children. It is this understanding that offers a foundation for principled objections to those who would pursue the imprudent agenda of dismantling an institution that has served us well, and replacing it with newer and more flexible understandings that are of questionable public value. I also believe in the institution of republican government as described in the United States Constitution. This, too, is an institution that has served us well, founded upon the precept that the American people speak through their elected representatives, and these representatives remain at all times answerable and accountable to the people whom they serve. Today, on the question of marriage, we are told by advocates on both sides of the debate that these two institutions, as they are currently understood, cannot be reconciled, and that one or the other must be changed. I do not agree, and thus I do not at this time support the proposed Marriage Protection Amendment. The proposed amendment would establish in our Constitution a permanent resolution of a debate that is currently and properly being resolved in different ways, in fifty different states, by the people's elected representatives. Our system of federalism is not easily separable from our commitment to republican government, because it is driven by the idea that we are best governed when those who represent us live where we live, and share the values that we share. It is this understanding that has allowed us the strength, as a nation, to time and again preserve our unity and confront our challenges in times of crisis, no matter how great our differences on issues that are the subject of heated public debate. The continued vitality of America's commitment to federalism and republican government offers a hopeful example to strife-torn areas of our world where conflicts are tragically settled with bullets rather than ballots. The Constitutional value of federalism is doubly important in the area of family law, because power to legislate in this area has traditionally been reserved to the states, and because issues of family structure affect the fabric of the broader community, creating the opportunity for approaches that reflect the values of the states that form our nation. Most Americans believe, as do I, that the institution of marriage should be reserved for the union of a man and a woman. Wherever the question of same-sex marriage has been put to the test of public approval, it has been decisively rejected. Presently, nineteen states protect in their constitutions traditional definitions of marriage. In 2004, amendments to state constitutions preserving the institution of marriage exclusively as the union of a man and woman were placed on the ballot in thirteen states. All thirteen passed by substantial margins. Thus far, seven states have a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year. There is little doubt they will all prevail. Proponents of an amendment to my state's constitution, which I support, are working hard to collect the required number of signatures to secure a place on the November ballot. If we succeed, I am certain Arizonans will adopt it overwhelmingly. There can be little doubt that a sizeable majority of the American people, whatever their views on other questions involving the rights of homosexuals in our society, strongly support reserving the institution of marriage for the union of one man and one woman. That majority includes, I am confident, majorities in every state in the union. It includes Americans of both political parties, whose voting habits and general political philosophy range from conservative to moderate to liberal. It is obvious that there is a broad consensus in this country in support of the traditional definition of marriage. And, Mr. President, when the American people are so decided in a public debate their elected representatives will defend that consensus. Forty-five states have either constitutional protections or statutes on the books defining marriage in traditional terms. In 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act, which allows each state to deny within its boundaries the status of marriage to the union of a same-sex couple that may have been recognized in another state. To date, the Defense of Marriage Act has not been successfully challenged in federal court. The broad consensus in support of traditional marriage does not yet extend to support for the measure we are debating today, an amendment to the federal constitution defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman. I suspect that is because most Americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples. Obviously, the Massachusetts Supreme Court's ruling in 2003 effectively extended lawful marriage to same-sex couples even though it is apparent that a majority of Massachusetts residents do not support that change in the interpretation of the states marriage laws. But there are political remedies to what, I believe, can be fairly criticized as judicial activism that ignored the will of the people and denied a state government its long established right to regulate marriage. In Massachusetts, more than 120,000 voters signed a petition to place on the ballot an amendment to the Commonwealth's constitution restoring the traditional definition of marriage. A constitutional convention to consider amending the Massachusetts constitution is scheduled to convene on July 12th. The Nebraska decision is under review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which has already heard oral arguments in the case, and might issue a ruling as early as this summer. Most analysts, on both sides of the debate, believe the lower court's decision will be reversed, and the exclusive protections for traditional marriage that the people of Nebraska adopted in 2000 by a vote of 70% will be restored to their constitution. Nebraska's Attorney General has not even felt it necessary to ask for a stay of the district court's decision pending the outcome of the appeal, which would almost certainly have been granted. I assume this is because Nebraska still has a defense of marriage law on the books, and there are no same sex marriage cases pending in Nebraska courts or same sex marriage legislation pending in the Nebraska legislature. I understand that the precipitous Massachusetts decision; as well as the unlawful granting of marriage licenses to same-sex couples in a few localities outside Massachusetts; challenges to traditional marriage laws in other states; and the decision last year by the federal district court in Nebraska that struck down an amendment to Nebraskas constitution restricting marriage to a man and a woman have added to the support for a federal marriage amendment. While that support does not mirror the broad national consensus in support of traditional marriage, it is substantial and passionate. I understand that and I respect it, and I agree that marriage as a uniquely important institution should be protected. But I do not agree that all the above circumstances have made it necessary to usurp from the states, by means of an amendment to the federal Constitution, their traditional role in regulating marriage. I'm reluctant to abandon the federalism that is part of the essence of conservative political thought in our country. And I am very wary of the unintended consequences that might follow from making an exception to our federalist principles for the sake of addressing a threat to the institution of marriage that may still, indeed, seems likely to be, defeated by means far less precedent setting than amending our nation's Constitution. Of course, while I disagree that the current Constitutional structure provides insufficient mechanisms for ensuring that the public meaning of marriage is not tampered with by activist judges, it would be disingenuous to argue that those who support the proposed Amendment have no grounds for their concern. In recent decades there have been too many occasions on which the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have forgotten their proper role, and abandoned the virtues of federalism and republican government in favor of imposing their own policy preferences in the guise of Constitutional interpretation. Decisions such as Roe v. Wade continue to distort the democratic process in ways large and small to this very day. It is a telling commentary on those who seek to change the longstanding public meaning of marriage that in many instances they have chosen to pursue their agenda through the courts rather than taking their case to the people. Those who wish to engage the issue in good faith should reject out-of-hand attempts to read into the Constitution a right to same-sex marriage, because the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it, and because the longstanding traditions of American society have defined legal marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Indeed, yet another reason I am reluctant to support the proposed Amendment at this point in time is that I do not accept the proposition that the current Constitution could ever reasonably be read to contain a supposed right that it plainly does not contain. It is just not clear to me, Mr. President, that threats to the institution of marriage that have arisen in recent times have become a permanent breach of state authorities' traditional role in regulating and defining marriage as the people of their states and their elected representatives see fit. My confidence that the public meaning of marriage will be decided in the context of federalism and republican government rather than by judicial fiat is strengthened by the recent confirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, and I hope that future appointments to the state and federal courts give us judges who share a similar understanding of the courts' proper role in our Constitutional system. However, if I am wrong, and the Nebraska decision were to be upheld on appeal; or were other challenges to state marriage laws made and upheld; or if majority sentiment and legislative remedies in affected states fail to overcome peremptory judicial intrusions into the political process of defining marriage; or if the Supreme Court were to reject the Defense of Marriage Act, then, and only then, would the problem justify Congress making the momentous decision to amend the most enduring and successful political compact in human history as the only recourse means to restore the public's right to define, according to the values and concerns of our communities, a critically important foundation of our society. Let me pose a hypothetical situation, Mr. President, to illustrate why we should be reluctant to impose a Constitutional remedy to a problem that will probably be resolved in an ordinary, state by state political process, consistent with the respect for federalism we Republicans have long claimed as one of our virtues. Those of us who consider ourselves pro-life would welcome the Supreme Court's reversal of the Roe v. Wade decision that found a Constitutional right to an abortion. The result of that reversal would be to return the regulation of abortion to the states, where the values of local communities would be influential. Now, further suppose that abortion rights advocates held majorities in both houses of Congress, and rather than argue state by state for liberal abortion laws, they decided to usurp the states' authority by means of a constitutional amendment protecting abortion. Wouldn't we who consider ourselves federalists loudly protest such a move? Wouldn't we all line up on the floor to quote Mr. Madison from Federalist Paper 45, that \"the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement and prosperity of the State.\" Yes, we would, Mr. President, yes, we would. Mr. President, I believe that in the \"ordinary course of affairs,\" the American people's clear preference to retain intact the institution of marriage, defined according to the values of our communities as the union of one man and one woman, will prevail, and that attempts to ignore the people's will, either by judicial fiat or by the occasional enterprising politician will, in due course, be overcome. I might be wrong, Mr. President, and I respect the concerns of Americans who believe current circumstances urgently require the Constitutional protection of traditionally defined marriage. But I do not believe that recent developments yet pose a threat to marriage that cannot be overcome by means short of a Constitutional amendment. While I will vote in opposition to this amendment, I believe its advocates should be reassured that if in the future the public meaning of marriage is taken from the hands of the people and altered by judges who claim falsely to speak before all others for the people's constitutional ideals, then it will be the people, acting through their elected representatives in this chamber, who will at that time have the final word. Until then, however, I will trust in the American people and the elected representatives closest to them to pass and enforce laws upholding the institution of marriage in accord with the values of their communities.\n\n# # # ####"

    "text": "June 9, 2009\n\nTG-162 Treasury Announces $68 Billion in Expected CPP Repayments WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced today that 10 of the largest U.S. financial institutions participating in the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) have met the requirements for repayment established by the primary federal banking supervisors. Following consultation with the primary banking supervisor of each institution, Treasury has notified the institutions that they are now eligible to complete the repayment process. If these firms choose to do so, Treasury will receive $68 billion in repayment proceeds. Combined with repayments received to date from other institutions, Treasury will have received approximately $70 billion in repayments from CPP participants. More than 600 banks across the country have participated in the CPP, representing $199 billion in investments. \"These repayments are an encouraging sign of financial repair, but we still have work to do,\" said Secretary Tim Geithner. These repayments follow a period in which many banks have successfully raised equity capital from private investors. Also, for the first time in many months, these banks have issued long-term debt that is not guaranteed by the government. Under the CPP investment agreements, firms that repay their preferred stock have the right to repurchase the warrants Treasury holds in their firms at fair market value. In addition to Treasury's potential income from sale of the warrants, these 10 institutions have already paid dividends on the preferred stock totaling approximately $1.8 billion over the last seven months. Dividend payments received for all CPP participants are approximately $4.5 billion to date. Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, proceeds from repayment will be applied to Treasury's general account. These repayments help to reduce Treasury's borrowing and national debt. The repayments also increase Treasury's cushion to respond to any future financial instability that might otherwise jeopardize economic recovery.\n\n###\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "The U.S. Internal Revenue code may make War and Peace read like a novella.\n\nThat\u2019s how onerous and confounding the nation\u2019s tax code is, according to Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th), who issued a news release April 15 calling for \"meaningful tax reform\" and blasting the complexity of the tax code.\n\n\"The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news,\" Lance said in the news release.\n\nBut not all the news is bad for Lance.\n\nLet\u2019s first review the size of the tax code and then compare that with the size of the Bible.\n\nA 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Taxpayer\u2019s Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word\u2019s word-count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at \u2018about 4 million.\u2019\n\nWe also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. CCH is a Wolters Kluwer business.\n\nSo Lance\u2019s claim about the number of words is generally accurate.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at number of pages. Lance said 5,600, based on the same figure cited by articles in the Washington Post, the Harvard Business Review and other publications, according to Todd Mitchell, Lance\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nMark Luscombe, a principal federal tax analyst for CCH, said the publisher\u2019s version of the tax code is 5,036 pages.\n\n\"Private publishers do a print version of the Internal Revenue code, but then you\u2019re looking at one private publisher\u2019s version of the code,\" he said. \"We do it in two volumes and we keep condensing it.\"\n\nThe key point here? Letter size, font and spacing matter when counting pages in the tax code and even in the Bible.\n\nDennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary said an approximation of 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined is fair.\n\n\"The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,\" Olson said in an e-mail.\n\nHellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, said there\u2019s no standard way to measure the size of the Bible, given its numerous translations and texts but said she, too, was aware of estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words.\n\nMardaga also noted that dividing 4 million \u2013 the number of words in the tax code \u2013 by 800,000 - would mean the tax code is five times longer than the Bible -- not Lance\u2019s seven.\n\nWe looked at versions of the King James and New American Standard versions of the Bible on Amazon.com, an online retailer of books and other merchandise. The four Bibles we looked at ranged in size from 512 pages to 1,112. Accordingly, Mitchell said he has seen numerous references comparing the size of the tax code with the Bible, ranging from 4 times as long to 10 times as long. Seven, he said, is in the middle.\n\n\"It all depends on what version (of the Bible) you have in front of you,\" he said. \"I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a right or wrong answer to the question.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nLance said, \"The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news.\"\n\nIt\u2019s generally accepted that the code is about 4 million words in length, according to previous published reports and the publisher of the 2013 winter version of the tax code. Lance also based his figure of 5,600 pages on previous reports from publications such as the Harvard Business Review. Opinions also differ on the code\u2019s length when compared with the Bible, given the many versions, translations and texts of it. And while the tax code isn\u2019t seven times as long as the Bible, even given a standard word count for the good book, we get Lance\u2019s overall point: the tax code is long and complex. We rate his claim Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com."

    "text": "A dangerous sentiment on the left threatens to derail what could be the biggest progressive achievement in half a century. It's the view that any health-care reform that doesn't include a public option isn't \"real\" reform and thus isn't worth doing. This mantra has become an article of faith among many Democrats who haven't necessarily thought through the matter but who take their cues from leaders advancing this argument. Unless liberals rethink this premise, and fast, Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal of the uninsured, bring health security to every American family and begin the long-term process of getting national health costs under control.\n\nThe first fallacy of the \"public option or nothing\" mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost -- 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured.\n\nThose countries also boast better health outcomes than we do, even when compared to states with similar demographics, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts. Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers (rather than shunned, as they are in the United States) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government-designed system of \"risk adjustment.\" The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems, such as those in Britain and Canada, are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage. In fact, as these two countries show, it is possible to cover everyone without a \"big government takeover.\"\n\nA related fallacy is that the public option is the most important issue to debate. It's not. The central progressive breakthrough in any reform should be to make it possible for every American to access group health coverage outside the employment setting -- access that does not currently exist but which the proposed insurance exchanges would enable. What's critical, therefore, is the structure of these exchanges and the rules about who would be eligible to use them. Such questions have received disturbingly little attention but need to be front and center. For example, some legislation proposes barring people who enjoy employer-based coverage from seeking insurance from the new exchanges; this ban should be scrapped in favor of the proposal offered by Sen. Ron Wyden, under which employees could use the cash their companies spend on their benefits to buy coverage they prefer at the exchange.\n\nI respect those in my party who seek the single-payer system into which the public option might eventually evolve. But I don't agree that it's the best answer for the United States. Though single payer has merits, especially in administrative efficiency, it is also likely to freeze in place our fragmented, uncoordinated system of fee-for-service care. It would encourage providers to goose volume (to boost their incomes) rather than improve quality and would offer greater rewards for providers of acute care when we need a fresh focus on chronic disease management. Single payer also asks government to do things I don't think it is competent to do, such as setting prices across a large swath of the health sector in ways that seem certain to create damaging rigidities or resource misallocations (as happens in Medicare).\n\nFinally, if government is the sole payer, provider payments will become even more politicized than they are today. On the eve of beneficial innovations in drug therapies, devices and cost-effective ways to deliver better care, it is ill-advised to make the government's hand too rigid. Private health plans have many flaws, to be sure, but if sensibly regulated they're likely to respond more nimbly to disperse medical innovations.\n\nLiberals should make peace with the notion that a regulated market of competing private health plans can be the vehicle for getting everyone covered. Yes, it means that unlike some other advanced countries, we'll have billions of \"health\" dollars siphoned off by middlemen and marketers. But if liberals think of it as a jobs program, they'll learn to love it. If everyone's covered and insurer \"cherry-picking\" is dead, health insurance will come to look more like a regulated utility.\n\nThose on the left still seeking incentive should consider: In 2006, Sen. Ted Kennedy urged Massachusetts Democrats to support Mitt Romney's plan for universal coverage via a competing system of regulated private insurers, paired with an individual mandate and subsidies for low earners. Kennedy knew this would become a model for a bipartisan fix for the country. Now, a Kennedy-approved model is within reach. Liberals, far from resisting it as a setback, should celebrate it as a triumph.\n\nMatt Miller, a former Clinton White House aide, is a management consultant and the author of \"The Tyranny of Dead Ideas.\" In recent years he has advised and given paid speeches to doctor groups, hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and insurance companies, as well as to low-income advocacy groups promoting universal coverage."

    "text": "Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.\n\n\"He talks tough on some of these issues,\" Rubio said Dec. 13. \"For example, he was going to \u2018carpet bomb\u2019 ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.\n\nWe decided to fact-check Rubio\u2019s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.\n\nCruz\u2019s vote on Rand Paul\u2019s budget proposal\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Cruz\u2019s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul\u2019s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.\n\nRubio\u2019s campaign pointed to Paul\u2019s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:\n\n\"This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,\" Paul wrote. \"It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.\"\n\nUnder Paul\u2019s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.\n\nWas Paul\u2019s proposal a \u2018cut\u2019 for defense?\n\nSo why did Rubio refer to Paul\u2019s budget as a \"cut\" if defense spending would rise?\n\n\"We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,\" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.\n\nBut experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul\u2019s proposal a \"cut.\"\n\n\"Paul\u2019s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president\u2019s budget was an even larger increase),\" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"But Paul\u2019s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama\u2019s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.\n\nChristopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul\u2019s budget a \"cut.\"\n\n\"As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,\" he said. \"This is misleading.\"\n\nCruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.\n\n\"So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a \u2018cut\u2019 when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,\" Phillips said. \"The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.\"\n\nBenjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz\u2019s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul\u2019s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.\n\n\"This was a budget, so it doesn\u2019t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,\" Friedman said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio said that the only budget Cruz \"ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\"\n\nRubio was referring to Cruz\u2019s vote in favor of Paul\u2019s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul\u2019s plan when he called it a \"cut.\" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.\n\nHowever, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul\u2019s proposal for defense was below Obama\u2019s request.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False."

    "text": "Sponsored Links\n\nRepublican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their \u201canatomical sex:\u201d\n\nLocal school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.\n\nHe did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student\u2019s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that."

    "text": "Home / President\n\nFOXNews.com\n\nThe following is a transcript of former Vice President Dick Cheney's remarks at the Center for Security Policy:\n\nThank you all very much. It's a pleasure to be here, and especially to receive the Keeper of the Flame Award in the company of so many good friends.\n\nI'm told that among those you've recognized before me was my friend Don Rumsfeld. I don't mind that a bit. It fits something of a pattern. In a career that includes being chief of staff, congressman, and secretary of defense, I haven't had much that Don didn't get first. But truth be told, any award once conferred on Donald Rumsfeld carries extra luster, and I am very proud to see my name added to such a distinguished list.\n\nTo Frank Gaffney and all the supporters of Center for Security Policy, I thank you for this honor. And I thank you for the great energy and high intelligence you bring to as vital a cause as there is - the advance of freedom and the uncompromising defense of the United States.\n\nMost anyone who is given responsibility in matters of national security quickly comes to appreciate the commitments and structures put in place by others who came before. You deploy a military force that was planned and funded by your predecessors. You inherit relationships with partners and obligations to allies that were first undertaken years and even generations earlier. With the authority you hold for a little while, you have great freedom of action. And whatever course you follow, the essential thing is always to keep commitments, and to leave no doubts about the credibility of your country's word.\n\nSo among my other concerns about the drift of events under the present administration, I consider the abandonment of missile defense in Eastern Europe to be a strategic blunder and a breach of good faith.\n\nIt is certainly not a model of diplomacy when the leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic are informed of such a decision at the last minute in midnight phone calls. It took a long time and lot of political courage in those countries to arrange for our interceptor system in Poland and the radar system in the Czech Republic. Our Polish and Czech friends are entitled to wonder how strategic plans and promises years in the making could be dissolved, just like that - with apparently little, if any, consultation. Seventy years to the day after the Soviets invaded Poland, it was an odd way to mark the occasion.\n\nYou hardly have to go back to 1939 to understand why these countries desire - and thought they had - a close and trusting relationship with the United States. Only last year, the Russian Army moved into Georgia, under the orders of a man who regards the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century. Anybody who has spent much time in that part of the world knows what Vladimir Putin is up to. And those who try placating him, by conceding ground and accommodating his wishes, will get nothing in return but more trouble.\n\nWhat did the Obama Administration get from Russia for its abandonment of Poland and the Czech Republic, and for its famous \"Reset\" button? Another deeply flawed election and continued Russian opposition to sanctioning Iran for its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn the short of it, President Obama's cancellation of America's agreements with the Polish and Czech governments was a serious blow to the hopes and aspirations of millions of Europeans. For twenty years, these peoples have done nothing but strive to move closer to us, and to gain the opportunities and security that America offered. These are faithful friends and NATO allies, and they deserve better. The impact of making two NATO allies walk the plank won't be felt only in Europe. Our friends throughout the world are watching and wondering whether America will abandon them as well.\n\nBig events turn on the credibility of the United States - doing what we said we would do, and always defending our fundamental security interests. In that category belong the ongoing missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the need to counter the nuclear ambitions of the current regime in Iran.\n\nCandidate Obama declared last year that he would be willing to sit down with Iran's leader without preconditions. As President, he has\n\ncommitted America to an Iran strategy that seems to treat engagement as an objective rather than a tactic. Time and time again, he has outstretched his hand to the Islamic Republic's authoritarian leaders, and all the while Iran has continued to provide lethal support to extremists and terrorists who are killing American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic continues to provide support to extremists in Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. Meanwhile, the regime continues to spin centrifuges and test missiles. And these are just the activities we know about.\n\nI have long been skeptical of engagement with the current regime in\n\nTehran, but even Iran experts who previously advocated for engagement have changed their tune since the rigged elections this past June and the brutal suppression of Iran's democratic protestors. The administration clearly missed an opportunity to stand with Iran's\n\ndemocrats, whose popular protests represent the greatest challenge to the Islamic Republic since its founding in 1979. Instead, the\n\nPresident has been largely silent about the violent crackdown on Iran's protestors, and has moved blindly forward to engage Iran's authoritarian regime. Unless the Islamic Republic fears real consequences from the United States and the international community, it is hard to see how diplomacy will work.\n\nNext door in Iraq, it is vitally important that President Obama, in his rush to withdraw troops, not undermine the progress we've made in recent years. Prime Minister Maliki met yesterday with\n\nPresident Obama, who began his press availability with an extended\n\ncomment about Afghanistan. When he finally got around to talking\n\nabout Iraq, he told the media that he reiterated to Maliki his\n\nintention to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq. Former President\n\nBush's bold decision to change strategy in Iraq and surge U.S. forces there set the stage for success in that country. Iraq has the potential to be a strong, democratic ally in the war on terrorism, and an example of economic and democratic reform in the heart of the Middle East. The Obama Administration has an obligation to protect this young democracy and build on the strategic success we have achieved in Iraq.\n\nWe should all be concerned as well with the direction of policy on Afghanistan. For quite a while, the cause of our military in that country went pretty much unquestioned, even on the left. The effort was routinely praised by way of contrast to Iraq, which many wrote off as a failure until the surge proved them wrong. Now suddenly - and despite our success in Iraq - we're hearing a drumbeat of defeatism over Afghanistan. These criticisms carry the same air of hopelessness, they offer the same short-sighted arguments for walking away, and they should be summarily rejected for the same reasons of national security.\n\nHaving announced his Afghanistan strategy last March, President Obama now seems afraid to make a decision, and unable to provide his commander on the ground with the troops he needs to complete his mission.\n\nPresident Obama has said he understands the stakes for America. When he announced his new strategy he couched the need to succeed in the starkest possible terms, saying, quote, \"If the Afghan government falls to the Taliban - or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged - that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.\" End quote.\n\nFive months later, in August of this year, speaking at the VFW, the President made a promise to America's armed forces. \"I will give you a clear mission,\" he said, \"defined goals, and the equipment and support you need to get the job done. That's my commitment to you.\"\n\nIt's time for President Obama to make good on his promise. The White House must stop dithering while America's armed forces are in danger.\n\nMake no mistake, signals of indecision out of Washington hurt our allies and embolden our adversaries. Waffling, while our troops on the ground face an emboldened enemy, endangers them and hurts our cause.\n\nRecently, President Obama's advisors have decided that it's easier to blame the Bush Administration than support our troops. This weekend they leveled a charge that cannot go unanswered. The President's chief of staff claimed that the Bush Administration hadn't asked any tough questions about Afghanistan, and he complained that the Obama Administration had to start from scratch to put together a strategy.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, fully aware of the need to meet new challenges being posed by the Taliban, we dug into every aspect of Afghanistan policy, assembling a team that traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan, reviewing options and recommendations, and briefing President-elect Obama's team. They asked us not to announce our findings publicly, and we agreed, giving them the benefit of our work and the benefit of the doubt. The new strategy they embraced in March, with a focus on counterinsurgency and an increase in the numbers of troops, bears a striking resemblance to the strategy we passed to them. They made a decision - a good one, I think - and sent a commander into the field to implement it.\n\nNow they seem to be pulling back and blaming others for their failure to implement the strategy they embraced. It's time for President Obama to do what it takes to win a war he has repeatedly and rightly called a war of necessity.\n\nIt's worth recalling that we were engaged in Afghanistan in the 1980's, supporting the Mujahadeen against the Soviets. That was a successful policy, but then we pretty much put Afghanistan out of our minds. While no one was watching, what followed was a civil war, the takeover by the Taliban, and the rise of bin Laden and al-Qaeda. All of that set in motion the events of 9/11. When we deployed forces eight years ago this month, it was to make sure Afghanistan would never again be a training ground for the killing of Americans. Saving untold thousands of lives is still the business at hand in this fight. And the success of our mission in Afghanistan is not only essential, it is entirely achievable with enough troops and enough political courage.\n\nThen there's the matter of how to handle the terrorists we capture in this ongoing war. Some of them know things that, if shared, can save a good many innocent lives. When we faced that problem in the days and years after 9/11, we made some basic decisions. We understood that organized terrorism is not just a law-enforcement issue, but a strategic threat to the United States.\n\nAt every turn, we understood as well that the safety of the country required collecting information known only to the worst of the terrorists. We had a lot of blind spots - and that's an awful thing, especially in wartime. With many thousands of lives potentially in the balance, we didn't think it made sense to let the terrorists answer questions in their own good time, if they answered them at all.\n\nThe intelligence professionals who got the answers we needed from terrorists had limited time, limited options, and careful legal guidance. They got the baddest actors we picked up to reveal things they really didn't want to share. In the case of Khalid Sheik Muhammed, by the time it was over he was not was not only talking, he was practically conducting a seminar, complete with chalkboards and charts. It turned out he had a professorial side, and our guys didn't mind at all if classes ran long. At some point, the mastermind of 9/11 became an expansive briefer on the operations and plans of al-Qaeda. It happened in the course of enhanced interrogations. All the evidence, and common sense as well, tells us why he started to talk.\n\nThe debate over intelligence gathering in the seven years after 9/11 involves much more than historical accuracy. What we're really debating are the means and resolve to protect this country over the next few years, and long after that. Terrorists and their state sponsors must be held accountable, and America must remain on the offensive against them. We got it right after 9/11. And our government needs to keep getting it right, year after year, president after president, until the danger is finally overcome.\n\nOur administration always faced its share of criticism, and from some quarters it was always intense. That was especially so in the later years of our term, when the dangers were as serious as ever, but the sense of general alarm after 9/11 was a fading memory. Part of our responsibility, as we saw it, was not to forget the terrible harm that had been done to America \u2026 and not to let 9/11 become the prelude to something much bigger and far worse.\n\nEight years into the effort, one thing we know is that the enemy has spent most of this time on the defensive - and every attempt to strike inside the United States has failed. So you would think that our successors would be going to the intelligence community saying, \"How did you did you do it? What were the keys to preventing another attack over that period of time?\"\n\nInstead, they've chosen a different path entirely - giving in to the angry left, slandering people who did a hard job well, and demagoguing an issue more serious than any other they'll face in these four years. No one knows just where that path will lead, but I can promise you this: There will always be plenty of us willing to stand up for the policies and the people that have kept this country safe.\n\nOn the political left, it will still be asserted that tough interrogations did no good, because this is an article of faith for them, and actual evidence is unwelcome and disregarded. President Obama himself has ruled these methods out, and when he last addressed the subject he filled the air with vague and useless platitudes. His preferred device is to suggest that we could have gotten the same information by other means. We're invited to think so. But this ignores the hard, inconvenient truth that we did try other means and techniques to elicit information from Khalid Sheikh Muhammed and other al-Qaeda operatives, only turning to enhanced techniques when we failed to produce the actionable intelligence we knew they were withholding. In fact, our intelligence professionals, in urgent circumstances with the highest of stakes, obtained specific information, prevented specific attacks, and saved American lives.\n\nIn short, to call enhanced interrogation a program of torture is not only to disregard the program's legal underpinnings and safeguards. Such accusations are a libel against dedicated professionals who acted honorably and well, in our country's name and in our country's cause. What's more, to completely rule out enhanced interrogation in the future, in favor of half-measures, is unwise in the extreme. In the fight against terrorism, there is no middle ground, and half-measures keep you half exposed.\n\nFor all that we've lost in this conflict, the United States has never lost its moral bearings - and least of all can that be said of our armed forces and intelligence personnel. They have done right, they have made our country safer, and a lot of Americans are alive today because of them.\n\nLast January 20th, our successors in office were given the highest honors that the voters of this country can give any two citizens. Along with that, George W. Bush and I handed the new president and vice president both a record of success in the war on terror, and the policies to continue that record and ultimately prevail. We had been the decision makers, but those seven years, four months, and nine days without another 9/11 or worse, were a combined achievement: a credit to all who serve in the defense of America, including some of the finest people I've ever met.\n\nWhat the present administration does with those policies is their call to make, and will become a measure of their own record. But I will tell you straight that I am not encouraged when intelligence officers who acted in the service of this country find themselves hounded with a zeal that should be reserved for America's enemies. And it certainly is not a good sign when the Justice Department is set on a political mission to discredit, disbar, or otherwise persecute the very people who helped protect our nation in the years after 9/11.\n\nThere are policy differences, and then there are affronts that have to be answered every time without equivocation, and this is one of them. We cannot protect this country by putting politics over security, and turning the guns on our own guys.\n\nWe cannot hope to win a war by talking down our country and those who do its hardest work - the men and women of our military and intelligence services. They are, after all, the true keepers of the flame.\n\nThank you very much."

    "text": "Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.\n\nThe bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)\n\nOhio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nSo when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.\n\nPortman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\n\"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\"\n\nThe report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEA\u2019s term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\"\n\nThe National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.\n\nMexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.\n\nDrugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.\n\nSmugglers\u2019 creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn\u2019t been studying drug facts for nothing.\n\nWe rate this claim True."

Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.\n\nLESTER HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.\n\nThe participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.\n\nThe 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.\n\nThe questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.\n\nI will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: How are you, Donald?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Good luck to you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWell, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.\n\nCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.\n\nWe're calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.\n\nThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.\n\nI want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.\n\nCLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.\n\nAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.\n\nHow are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.\n\nFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.\n\nMr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.\n\nSo we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.\n\nSo Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.\n\nBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.\n\nTRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.\n\nCompanies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.\n\nWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.\n\nI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.\n\nWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.\n\nI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.\n\nI don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.\n\nAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.\n\nHOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.\n\nOur country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.\n\nSo we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.\n\nLet me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.\n\nNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\n\nBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...\n\nHOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?\n\nTRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.\n\nAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.\n\nAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.\n\nHOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\n\nIn fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\" Well, it did collapse.\n\nTRUMP: That's called business, by the way.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.\n\nNow, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.\n\nIndependent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\n\nThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.\n\nTRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that.\n\nCLINTON: I think science is real.\n\nTRUMP: I do not say that.\n\nCLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.\n\nSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.\n\nNow, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.\n\nThe Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.\n\nSo I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.\n\nAnd all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.\n\nAnd, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.\n\nCLINTON: Well, actually...\n\nTRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.\n\nCLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.\n\nCLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...\n\nTRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget...\n\nTRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.\n\nCLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.\n\nWhen I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.\n\nBut let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly...\n\nTRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...\n\nCLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...\n\nTRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it.\n\nCLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nCLINTON: And I have done a lot...\n\nTRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.\n\nTRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.\n\nAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.\n\nCLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...\n\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.\n\nCLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...\n\nTRUMP: Not.\n\nCLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...\n\nTRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: ... before you even announced.\n\nTRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: Look, there are differences...\n\nTRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?\n\nCLINTON: There are...\n\nTRUMP: Because he's pushing it.\n\nCLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.\n\nTRUMP: But you have no plan.\n\nCLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do.\n\nTRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.\n\nCLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called \"Stronger Together.\" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...\n\nTRUMP: That's about all you've...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: Folks, we're going to...\n\nCLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.\n\nHOLT: We're going to move to...\n\nCLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.\n\nSo we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.\n\nTRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.\n\nAnd by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.\n\nWhen I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.\n\nI'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.\n\nHOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes...\n\nCLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left to stand.\n\nHOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.\n\nCLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...\n\nTRUMP: Facts.\n\nCLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...\n\nTRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.\n\nCLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.\n\nHOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.\n\nTRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think I...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here...\n\nTRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.\n\nHOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...\n\nTRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...\n\nTRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.\n\nHOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...\n\nCLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.\n\nHOLT: ... achieving prosperity...\n\nTRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.\n\nCLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not.\n\nTRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\n\nCLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.\n\nHOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.\n\nSecretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job.\n\nI'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand.\n\nAnd when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.\n\nSo what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.\n\nInstead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.\n\nAnd here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.\n\nBut we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.\n\nHOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\n\nTRUMP: Why not?\n\nCLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...\n\nTRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.\n\nHOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\n\nTRUMP: Yes.\n\nCLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.\n\nTRUMP: Then you didn't read it.\n\nCLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a...\n\nTRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing...\n\nTRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is...\n\nTRUMP: Lester, how much?\n\nCLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.\n\nAnd a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.\n\nCLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...\n\nTRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.\n\nNow, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.\n\nWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?\n\nTRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.\n\nBut you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.\n\nBut that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?\n\nWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.\n\nHOLT: The IRS says an audit...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me.\n\nHOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...\n\nTRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.\n\nAnd in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't.\n\nI will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, \"Don't do it.\" I will tell you this. No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.\n\nHOLT: So it's negotiable?\n\nTRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...\n\nHOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.\n\nSo you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.\n\nCLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.\n\nTRUMP: That makes me smart.\n\nCLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.\n\nAnd the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.\n\nAnd we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.\n\nHOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?\n\nCLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That's for sure.\n\nCLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.\n\nAs far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.\n\nThe other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.\n\nThe buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that.\n\nBut I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.\n\nI am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.\n\nWhen we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.\n\nYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.\n\nSo the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.\n\nAnd it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.\n\nHOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.\n\nCLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. (APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd the other thing I think is important...\n\nTRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me.\n\nCLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.\n\nAnd, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.\n\nWe have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...\n\nTRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...\n\nCLINTON: Well, to...\n\nTRUMP: Which our country should do, too.\n\nCLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?\n\nI can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.\n\nAnd when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.\n\nHOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...\n\nCLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that.\n\nTRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company.\n\nBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.\n\nNow, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do.\n\nBut what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.\n\nBut we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing.\n\nWe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.\n\nWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.\n\nHOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race.\n\nThe share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.\n\nSo how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.\n\nCLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.\n\nAnd we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.\n\nCLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.\n\nBut we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\n\nThe gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.\n\nHOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.\n\nAnd when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.\n\nI just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.\n\nWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.\n\nIn Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.\n\nNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.\n\nWe have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.\n\nWe have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.\n\nHOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.\n\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.\n\nHOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.\n\nTRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.\n\nThese are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.\n\nYou need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.\n\nBut when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.\n\nTRUMP: You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.\n\nBut you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton...\n\nTRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Ugh.\n\nCLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.\n\nBut we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.\n\nNow, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.\n\nBut there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.\n\nWe need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.\n\nAnd I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.\n\nAnd we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?\n\nCLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?\n\nBut when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.\n\nI've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.\n\nCLINTON: They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to respond to that.\n\nHOLT: Please.\n\nTRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.\n\nBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.\n\nI do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.\n\nAnd when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.\n\nI think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?\n\nBut we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\n\nCLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...\n\nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong.\n\nCLINTON: No, I'm not.\n\nTRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it.\n\nCLINTON: New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.\n\nLook, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?\n\nBut let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.\n\nHOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...\n\nTRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might.\n\nHOLT: Please -- 20 seconds.\n\nTRUMP: I'd just like to respond.\n\nHOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.\n\nTRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.\n\nThe African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: Well, I -- I do think...\n\nTRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I...\n\nCLINTON: I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?\n\nTRUMP: I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.\n\nTRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.\n\nWhen I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.\n\nHOLT: That was...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.\n\nHOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nHOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?\n\nTRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.\n\nSecretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.\n\nHOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.\n\nBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.\n\nAnd I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.\n\nBut it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.\n\nBut, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.\n\nSo he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.\n\nBut I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.\n\nTRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that.\n\nBut just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't.\n\nNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.\n\nTRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money.\n\nBut, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.\n\nI'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.\n\nHOLT: Our next segment is called \"Securing America.\" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n\nSecretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.\n\nBut increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.\n\nAnd we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.\n\nAnd the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes have expired.\n\nCLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?\n\nTRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it.\n\nIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.\n\nSo when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in.\n\nAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?\n\nTRUMP: You don't know who broke in to DNC.\n\nBut what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned.\n\nNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.\n\nWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS.\n\nSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.\n\nBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.\n\nBut we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.\n\nWe're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.\n\nBut we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.\n\nAnd I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.\n\nHOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \"We will take out ISIS.\" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.\n\nSo she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them.\n\nOr, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.\n\nCLINTON: But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.\n\nAnd the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.\n\nBut let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?\n\nAnd I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.\n\nSo we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.\n\nWe're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.\n\nThey're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to respond.\n\nHOLT: Please respond.\n\nTRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.\n\nBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.\n\nBut when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.\n\nNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.\n\nAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.\n\nAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.\n\nAnd they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.\n\nI think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said...\n\nCLINTON: Lester, we've covered...\n\nTRUMP: No, wait a minute.\n\nCLINTON: We've covered this ground.\n\nTRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...\n\nTRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.\n\nHOLT: In 2002...\n\nTRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\n\nHOLT: My question is, since you supported it...\n\nTRUMP: Just -- would you like to hear...\n\nHOLT: ... why is your -- why is your judgment...\n\nTRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.\n\nHOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...\n\nTRUMP: The record does not show that.\n\nHOLT: Why was -- is your judgment any...\n\nTRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.\n\nHOLT: Why is your judgment better than...\n\nTRUMP: And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.\n\nAnd I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.\n\nAnd one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster.\n\nHOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...\n\nTRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said.\n\nHOLT: Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nTRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.\n\nHOLT: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Whew, OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLet's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.\n\nWith respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.\n\nAnd we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.\n\nAnd we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations.\n\nThe other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.\n\nTRUMP: That would not start a war.\n\nCLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...\n\nTRUMP: No, they were taunting us.\n\nCLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...\n\nTRUMP: Wrong.\n\nCLINTON: ... have a good time, folks.\n\nTRUMP: It's lies.\n\nCLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.\n\nTRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...\n\nCLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.\n\nNuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...\n\nHOLT: We need to move on.\n\nTRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.\n\nHOLT: Our last...\n\nTRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.\n\nHOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.\n\nI looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.\n\nI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.\n\nAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.\n\nAnd when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.\n\nAnd when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.\n\nSo you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes is expired.\n\nTRUMP: And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.\n\nHOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.\n\nIt is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.\n\nIt's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.\n\nAnd Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.\n\nSo we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.\n\nWe cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...\n\nHOLT: Your two minutes is...\n\nCLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all.\n\nHOLT: ... is expired.\n\nTRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds.\n\nTRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump...\n\nTRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world...\n\nHOLT: We have just...\n\nTRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what we need.\n\nHOLT: We have just a few final questions...\n\nTRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, \"a presidential look.\" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that?\n\nTRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\n\nHOLT: The quote was, \"I just don't think she has the presidential look.\"\n\nTRUMP: You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?\n\nYou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.\n\nHOLT: Let's let her respond. CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.\n\nHOLT: We are at -- we are at the final question.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.\n\nHOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.\n\nCLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...\n\nTRUMP: I never said that.\n\nCLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\n\nTRUMP: I didn't say that.\n\nCLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman \"Miss Piggy.\" Then he called her \"Miss Housekeeping,\" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.\n\nTRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this?\n\nCLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.\n\nTRUMP: Where did you find this?\n\nCLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November.\n\nTRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...\n\nTRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.\n\nBut you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...\n\nHOLT: Please very quickly.\n\nTRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations.\n\nAnd I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that.\n\nBut it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...\n\nHOLT: We have to move on to the final question.\n\nTRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.\n\nAnd I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.\n\nHOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.\n\nThe other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.\n\nHOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?\n\nTRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.\n\nThe next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue."

Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.\n\nThe bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)\n\nOhio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.\n\nBack in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nSo when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.\n\nPortman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\n\n\"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\"\n\nThe report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEA\u2019s term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\"\n\nThe National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.\n\nMexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.\n\nDrugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.\n\nSmugglers\u2019 creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn\u2019t been studying drug facts for nothing.\n\nWe rate this claim True."

I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBerman: \u201cIn your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?\u201d\n\nHorner: \u201cWhen no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn\u2019t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.\u201d\n\nBerman: \u201cYour book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various \u201ctortures\u201d that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?\u201d\n\nHorner: \u201cBecause I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBerman: \u201cCan you give us any insight on Obama\u2019s feelings towards the American people?\u201d\n\nHorner: \u201cHe constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as \u201cmongoloids\u201d and \u201cidiots\u201d. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.\u201d\n\nBerman: What is one of the things readers will find the most shocking?\n\nHorner: \u201cProbably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obama\u2019s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I\u2019ve ever witnessed. We\u2019re talking 10-15 partners in a single day.\u201d\n\nTo read more, pick up a copy of Horner\u2019s book, The Black House, now available on Amazon and at your local bookstore.\n\nVIDEO: Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book"

Little Terrence disappeared earlier today from the Capitol building, and didn\u2019t manage to make it fat before his young life was shut by forces of globalist.\n\nCongressman Trey Gowdy and his family did not come up with a statement. They ask for privacy and they are taking some family time in order to deal with the tragic loss of their son. His family and he, are at a high-security safehouse in an unknown location, so they can protect themselves.\n\nWe also found out that there are two suspects in the murder, Sanjay Gemtrapa and Hamil Lalahafa and they are being question. David Morrisey, an US attorney is in charge of the case. We will have more information as they come in!"

    "text": "At a campaign town hall event at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with \u201cradical\u201d positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking \u2013 I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That\u2019s what I believe,\u201d declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. \u201cI believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that\u2019s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,\u201d Rubio asserted.\n\n\n\nTaking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would \u201cput rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just totally against the whole shebang, I won\u2019t deny it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it\u2019s father has done to you, come on.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.\u201d\n\nAsked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: \u201cDon\u2019t know yet, first thing\u2019s first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.\u201d/SOURCE\n\nComments\n\ncomments"

    "text": "Chachi can now apologize to Joannie for being so rude. Scott Baio, 56, was killed when the single-engine Cessna he was in crashed into the side of a hill in Louisiana. Baio was headed to Mar-A-Lago to barbecue shrimp and play gold with President Trump.\n\nBaio\u2019s wife, Raylene, wasn\u2019t on the plane but was checked into St Timothy\u2019s on a suicide watch after the news sent her into a breakdown. Spokesmen for several actors who wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a film with Baio said that he was \u201creally special as Chachi\u201d and he \u201csure did do a nice job with Charles in Charge.\u201d\n\nBaio, wildly successful as an actor since the ripe age of 13, says he saved every dime he ever made so he could live the lavish lifestyle of jetting across the country to golf with famous and powerful people. Unfortunately, that ended with a net worth of about $3.5 million and a whole lot of that was tied up in that nice house of his, so Baio was forced to go Cessna instead, which only would have gotten him there slightly faster than that new Kia Sorento he\u2019s been sporting.\n\nBaio will be missed by many. His ability to retweet things in support of our glorious president without even bothering to care what they were truly drove the social media movement to get Trump elected. When he heard the news that Baio was killed, Trump asked for a moment of silence in the dining room during his morning coffee and strudel. He hasn\u2019t personally responded but Jeff Derpinger of the WHOIP told Freedom Crossroads correspondent Louis Leweigh:\n\n\u201cThe President was saddened by the news once we reminded him that Scott was once \u2018Chachi.\u2019 He said he wished he knew the kid was coming; he would have sent the jet.\u201d\n\nTo clear it up, libtards, he would probably send the company jet and not Air Force One. Maybe one of the smaller planes like the Secretary of State gets but nothing bigger than that. Baio\u2019s remains are scattered with the wreckage, with slammed nose first into a cliff face. The FCC said the pilot probably got disoriented in a cloud bank and came at a 30-degree downward angle directly into solid quartz with a touch of limestone. The plane fell nearly 1400 feet to the basin below where very little was recognizable.\n\nBaio had no known connection to the Clintons \u2014 Trey Gowdy is investigating."

    "text": "On Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has \u201csanctioned\u201d violence, as long it protects the \u201cpeople favorable to the Obama position, politically.\u201d She insisted that the president is sending \u201ca signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don\u2019t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.\u201d She also linked the Obama administration\u2019s \u201clawlessness\u201d to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving \u201cnormal\u201d people helpless in the face of anarchy.\n\n\u201cAnd these days it has become so obvious that I\u2019m honestly surprised we\u2019re not having riots throughout the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen did this become a nation of criminals? I didn\u2019t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I\u2019m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.\u201d\n\nThe ex-Rep. then argued that \u201cnot even slaves\u201d suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. \u201cIt\u2019s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I\u2019m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear \u2013 we\u2019re supposed to be all evolved right now, we\u2019re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He\u2019s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you\u2019ve seen in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Bachmann continued firing, \u201cI don\u2019t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what\u2019s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d She added, \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it, during that time, we\u2019ve had the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we\u2019ve had countless terrorist attacks, we\u2019ve had many racial killings and crimes and we\u2019ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America\u2019s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I\u2019m guessing he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s get one thing straight \u2013 I\u2019m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I\u2019d be saying the same thing all over again,\u201d Bachmann quipped. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to point out \u2013 white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I\u2019m seriously worried whether or not we\u2019ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we\u2019re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we\u2019ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another \u2013 white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that\u2019s just one step away from extinction,\u201d Bachmann concluded./politicot.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments"

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.\u201d he admits, visibly puzzled. \u201cIt is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAccording to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.\n\nU.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region\u2019s waters \u201cis highly unlikely\u201d as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.\n\nIn 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930."

EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Cincinnati! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Ohio! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, labor! (Applause.) All-righty. It is good to be back in Cincinnati. (Applause.) It's good to be back in Ohio. (Applause.) It's good to be back among great friends, great leaders. And I want everybody to give a big round of applause to Charlie Dilbert for that great introduction. (Applause.) And I want to thank Kathy Mattea and the band for the entertainment. Give Kathy a big round of applause. (Applause.)\n\nHow you all feeling today? (Applause.) Are you fired up? (Applause.) Are you ready to go? (Applause.) I can't think of a better place to be on Labor Day than at America's biggest Labor Day picnic, and with the workers and families of the Cincinnati AFL-CIO. (Applause.)\n\nI'm so proud to be on the stage with Charlie, because Charlie reminds us that in these tough times, America's working men and women are ready to roll up their sleeves and get back to work. (Applause.)\n\nI want to salute your local AFL-CIO local leaders: Executive Secretary-Treasurer Doug Sizemore -- (applause) -- President Joe Zimmer -- (applause) -- State President Joe Rugola. And your outstanding national leaders: a man who we thank for devoting his life to working Americans -- President John Sweeney. (Applause.) He's right there. And the man who will pick up the mantle, who will take the baton of leadership, who we need to succeed because a strong labor movement is part of a strong economy -- is part of a strong economy -- Secretary-Treasurer Rich Trumka. (Applause.)\n\nAlthough Ohio's wonderful governor and great friend of mine Ted Strickland couldn't be here, we've got Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher in the house -- (applause) -- Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner -- (applause) -- Attorney General Richard Cordray -- (applause) -- Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory -- (applause) -- Hamilton County Commissioner -- Commission President David Pepper. (Applause.)\n\nWe're joined by members of Ohio's outstanding congressional delegation: Congressman Steve Driehaus -- (applause) -- and a great friend who is at the forefront of every fight for Ohio's working men and women, including the battle for health insurance reform, Senator Sherrod Brown. (Applause.)\n\nI'm also proud to be here with a leader who is reenergizing the Department of Labor, who realizes that it's not the Department of Management, it's the Department of Labor -- (applause) -- a daughter of union members, a daughter of a Teamster -- Secretary Hilda Solis. (Applause.) My director of recovery for auto communities and workers, Ed Montgomery, is in the house, and he's doing outstanding work. (Applause.)\n\nNow, Cincinnati, like a lot of Americans, you're having some fun today. Taking the day off. Spending time with the kids. Some of you may be proud of your grilling skills. (Laughter.) Every man thinks he can grill -- (laughter) -- whether he can or not. That's what Michelle says. (Laughter.) Michelle says she's a better griller than me. (Applause.) I don't know. We'll have to have a grill-off someday. But you're enjoying some good music, some good food, some famous Cincinnati chili. (Applause.)\n\nBut today we also pause. We pause to remember and to reflect and to reaffirm. We remember that the rights and benefits we enjoy today weren't simply handed to America's working men and women. They had to be won. They had to be fought for, by men and women of courage and conviction, from the factory floors of the Industrial Revolution to the shopping aisles of today's superstores. They stood up and they spoke out to demand a fair shake and an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. (Applause.)\n\nMany risked their lives. Some gave their lives. Some made it a cause of their lives -- like Senator Ted Kennedy, who we remember today. (Applause.)\n\nSo let us never forget: much of what we take for granted -- the 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, health insurance, paid leave, pensions, Social Security, Medicare -- they all bear the union label. (Applause.) It was the American worker -- men and women just like you -- who returned from World War II to make our economy the envy of the world. It was labor that helped build the largest middle class in history. Even if you're not a union member, every American owes something to America's labor movement. (Applause.)\n\nSo as we remember this history, let's reflect on its meaning in our own time. Like so many Americans, you work hard. You meet your responsibilities. You play by the rules. You pay your bills. But in recent years, the American Dream seems like it's been slipping away, because from Washington to Wall Street, too often a different attitude prevailed. Wealth was valued over work, selfishness over sacrifice, greed over responsibility. The right to organize was undermined rather than strengthened. (Applause.)\n\nThat's what we saw. And it may have worked out well for those folks at the top, but it didn't work out for you and it didn't work out well for our country. That culture -- that culture and the policies that flowed from it -- undermined the middle class and helped create the greatest economic crisis of our time.\n\nSo today, on this Labor Day, we reaffirm our commitment. To rebuild. To live up to the legacy of those who came before us. To combine the enduring values that have served us so well for so long -- hard work and responsibility -- with new ideas for a new century. To ensure that our great middle class remains the backbone of our economy -- not just a vanishing ideal we celebrate at picnics once a year as summer turns to fall. We want it a reality for the families of Ohio and the families of America. (Applause.)\n\nThat's what we've been working to do ever since I took office. Now, I notice some people have already forgotten how bad it was just seven months ago. You notice that? They've got sort of selective amnesia. (Laughter.) So let's just remind them for a second. (Applause.) A financial system on the verge of collapse; about 700,000 workers losing their jobs each month; the worst recession of our lifetimes threatening to become another Great Depression.\n\nThat's what was happening just seven months ago. And that's why we took bold, swift action. That's why we passed an unprecedented Recovery Act, and we did it without the usual Washington earmarks and pork-barrel spending. And, Ohio, it is working. (Applause.)\n\nTimes -- times are still tough. Times are still tough, I know that. But we have given 95 percent of America's working families a tax cut -- 4.5 million families in Ohio, including here in Cincinnati -- a promise we made during the campaign; a promise I kept as President of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nWe cut taxes for small businesses, made new loans to more than 1,000 small businesses in Ohio so they could grow and hire more workers. We extended unemployment benefits for 12 million Americans, including Charlie and nearly 570,000 Ohio citizens. (Applause.) Across America, we've saved the jobs of tens of thousands of state and local workers, including teachers and first responders right here in Ohio. Don't take my word for it. Ask folks here in Ohio what they would have done if we hadn't passed the Recovery Act -- the cuts they would have had to make, the taxes they would have had to raise.\n\nWe're rebuilding America's infrastructure, including improvements to I-75 in Hamilton County, led by a local Cincinnati contractor. (Applause.) We've got more than 200 other highway projects across Ohio, and we're making a historic commitment to innovation -- much of it still to come in the months and years ahead: doubling our capacity to generate renewable energy; building a new smart grid to carry electricity from coast to coast; laying down broadband lines and high-speed rail lines and providing the largest boost in basic research in our history -- all of which will put people back to work. (Applause.) Steelworkers, plumbers, pipe-fitters, engineers, you name it.\n\nSo our recovery plan is working.\n\nQ What about bricklayers?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Bricklayers, too. (Applause.) The financial system -- financial system has been saved from collapse. Home sales are up. We're seeing signs of life in the auto industry. Business investment is starting to stabilize. For the first time in 18 months, we're seeing growth in manufacturing. When was the last time you heard that here in the United States of America? (Applause.)\n\nNow, on Friday, we learned that the economy lost another 216,000 jobs in August. And whenever Americans are losing jobs, that's simply unacceptable. But for the second straight month, we lost fewer jobs than the month before, and it was the fewest jobs that we had lost in a year. (Applause.) So, make no mistake, we're moving in the right direction. We're on the road to recovery, Ohio. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes we can! Yes we can! Yes we can!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes we will. Yes we are.\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes we will! Yes we will! Yes we will!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But -- but, my friends, we still have got a long way to go. We're not going to rest. We're not going to let up. Not until workers looking for jobs can find them -- good jobs that sustain families and sustain dreams. Not until responsible mortgage-owners can stay in their homes. Not until we've got a full economic recovery and all Americans have their shot at the American Dream. (Applause.)\n\nNow, we can't do that if we go back to that old economy -- overleveraged banks, inflated profits, maxed-out credit cards, CEOs and bankers getting multimillion-dollar bonuses --\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- an economy of bubbles and bursts, your wages and incomes stagnant while corporate profits soar. So even as we recover from the recession and work to cut the deficit, we have to build a new foundation for prosperity:\n\nWe need an America with a reformed financial system. We got to have regulations in place that protect consumers so that we never have a crisis like this again. (Applause.) I don't want to have to bail out any more banks. (Applause.) And we got to make sure we've got regulations in place to prevent it. (Applause.)\n\nAn America where energy reform creates green jobs that can never be outsourced and that finally frees America from the grip of foreign oil. (Applause.)\n\nAn America that commits to education because the countries that out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow and the best jobs will go to the best educated. (Applause.) So we got to do a better job educating our sons and our daughters. And, yes, I'm going to have something to say tomorrow to our children, telling them to stay in school and work hard -- because that's the right message to send. (Applause.)\n\nWe need an America that once again invests in the middle class, which is why I've created our task force for middle-class working families, led by my outstanding Vice President Joe Biden to make sure that our policies always benefit you, the American worker. (Applause.)\n\nToday we're taking another step. I'm naming Ron Bloom, who's right here -- raise your hand, Ron; he's right down in the front here. (Applause.) I'm naming Ron Bloom to lead our efforts to revitalize the sector that helped build the middle class: American manufacturing. (Applause.) Ron has worked with steelworkers, service employees, and management to create jobs. He helped guide our auto task force. And as my new point person on manufacturing, he's going to help us craft the policies that will create the next generation of great manufacturing jobs and ensure American competitiveness in the 21st century. (Applause.)\n\nOh, and by the way, just in case you were wondering, we're also going to build an America where health reform delivers more stability and security to every American. (Applause.) We are going to reform the system for those who have insurance and those who don't. Now, I'll have a lot more to say about this on Wednesday night. I might have to save my voice a little bit -- not get too excited. I don't want to give anything away. I want you all to tune in.\n\nBut let me just say a few things about this health care issue. We've been fighting for quality, affordable health care for every American for nearly a century -- since Teddy Roosevelt. Think about that -- long time. (Laughter.) The Congress and the country have now been vigorously debating the issue for many months. The debate has been good, and that's important because we've got to get this right. But every debate at some point comes to an end. At some point, it's time to decide. At some point, it's time to act. Ohio, it's time to act and get this thing done. (Applause.)\n\nWe have never been this close. We've never had such broad agreement on what needs to be done. And because we're so close to real reform, suddenly the special interests are doing what they always do, which is just try to scare the heck out of people.\n\nBut I've got -- I've got a question for all these folks who say, you know, we're going to pull the plug on Grandma and this is all about illegal immigrants -- you've heard all the lies. I've got a question for all those folks: What are you going to do? (Applause.) What's your answer? (Applause.) What's your solution? (Applause.) And you know what? They don't have one. (Applause.) Their answer is to do nothing. Their answer is to do nothing. And we know what that future looks like: insurance companies raking in the profits while discriminating against people because of preexisting conditions; denying or dropping coverage when you get sick. It means you're never negotiating about higher wages, because all you're spending your time doing is just trying to protect the benefits that you already fought for.\n\nIt means premiums continuing to skyrocket three times faster than your wages. It means more families pushed into bankruptcy, more businesses cutting more jobs, more Americans losing health insurance -- 14,000 every day. It means more Americans dying every day just because they don't have health insurance.\n\nThat's not the future I see for America. I see reform where we bring stability and security to folks who have insurance today -- where you never again have to worry about going without coverage if you lose your job or you change your job or you get sick. You've got coverage there for you. Where there is a cap on your out-of-pocket expenses, so you don't have to worry that a serious illness will break you and your family even if you have health insurance. (Applause.) Where you never again have to worry -- where you never again have to worry that you or someone you love will be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. (Applause.)\n\nI see reform where Americans and small businesses that are shut out of health insurance today will be able to purchase coverage at a price they can afford. (Applause.) Where they'll be able to shop and compare in a new health insurance exchange -- a marketplace where competition and choice will continue to hold down costs and help deliver them a better deal. And I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices will help improve quality and bring down costs. (Applause.)\n\nI see reform where we protect our senior citizens by closing the gaps in their prescription drug coverage under Medicare that costs older Americans thousands of dollars every years out of their pockets; reforms that will preserve Medicare and put it on a sounder financial footing and cut waste and fraud -- the more than $100 billion in unwarranted public subsidies to already profitable insurance companies.\n\nI want a health insurance system that works as well for the American people as it does for the insurance industry. (Applause.) They should be free to make a profit. But they also have to be fair. They also have to be accountable.\n\nThat's what we're talking about -- security and stability for folks who have health insurance, help for those they don't -- the coverage they need at a price they can afford, finally bringing costs under control. That's the reform that's needed. That's the reform we're fighting for. And that's why it's time to do what's right for America's working families and put aside partisanship, stop saying things that aren't true, come together as a nation, pass health insurance reform now -- this year. (Applause.)\n\nFew have fought harder or longer for health care in America's workers than you -- our brothers and sisters of organized labor. And just as we know that we have to adapt to all the changes and challenges of a global economy, we also know this: In good economic times and in bad, labor is not the problem. Labor is part of the solution. (Applause.)\n\nThat's why Secretary Solis made it her priority at the Labor Department to protect workers -- your safety, your benefits, your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively. (Applause.) That's why some of the first executive orders I issued overturned the previous administration's attempts to stifle organized labor. That's why I support EFCA -- to level the playing field so it's easier for employees who want a union to form a union. (Applause.) Nothing -- nothing wrong with that. Because when labor is strong, America is strong. When we all stand together, we all rise together. (Applause.)\n\nThat's why the first piece of legislation I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- (applause) -- guaranteeing equal pay for equal work. (Applause.) Lilly worked at a factory in Alabama. She did her job and she did it well. And then, after nearly two decades, she discovered that for years she was paid less than her male colleagues for doing the very same work. Over the years, she had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages and in pension and Social Security benefits.\n\nLilly could have just moved on. Instead, this Alabama grandmother made a decision. She said a principle was at stake. She stood up and she spoke out for what was right -- all the way to the Supreme Court, and then Congress, and finally the White House, where she stood next to me as I signed the law that bore her name. (Applause.)\n\nOhio, that's the lesson this day -- that some things are worth fighting for. (Applause.) Equal pay. Fair wages. Dignity in the workplace. Justice on the job. An economy that works for everybody, because in America there are no second-class citizens. An economy where you can make a living and care for your families. Where you're leaving your kids something better. Where we live up to our fundamental ideals. Those words put on paper some 200 years ago -- that we're all created equal, that we all deserve a chance to pursue our happiness -- that's the calling to which we are summoned this Labor Day. That's the cause of my presidency. And that is the commitment we must fulfill to preserve the American Dream for all of America's working families.\n\nBut I'm going to need you to do it. At the beginning of this speech, I talked about whether you were fired up. (Applause.) I know that, over the last couple months, the economy has been bad, the recession has been wearing on folks -- people losing their jobs, people losing their health care, people losing their homes in some cases. It's been the usual bickering in Washington. Doesn't seem like that ever stops. Pundits on TV, they're saying how, oh, this isn't working and that's not working. You know, you start getting into a funk, and whenever I see folks in that negative place, I always think back to a story I told during the campaign. Some of you have heard it. But I just thought I'd say it again. (Applause.)\n\nIt's about where the phrase \"fired up\" comes from. So, this is when we were -- right at the beginning of the campaign for the presidency, nobody gave us a chance -- none of you all could pronounce my name. (Laughter.) And I went down to South Carolina. I went down -- I think I was -- where was I? (Laughter.) I was in Greenville -- am I right? Greenville. And the legislators were having a little banquet and they had invited me to come down to speak. And I sat next to a state representative. I had nobody supporting me back then, so I had to ask everybody. I said, will you support my campaign for the presidency of the United States? And this state rep looked me up and down and she said, \"You know, I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown at Greenwood, South Carolina.\"\n\nNow, I had had a glass of wine, so I said right away, I said, okay. (Laughter.) Let's shake on it. Come to find out that Greenwood is about an hour and a half from everyplace else. (Laughter.)\n\nSo about a month later, I fly in -- I've been campaigning for two weeks straight, haven't seen my family, I'm exhausted, I'm tired. Get to the hotel room, I'm dragging my bag into my room, about to go to bed. I get a tap on my shoulder. It's my staff member, says, \"Excuse me, sir.\" I said, \"What?\" (Laughter.) He said, \"You have to be in the car tomorrow at 6:30 a.m. in the morning. I said, \"Why?\" (Laughter.) He said, \"Because we got to go to Greenwood like you promised.\" (Laughter.)\n\nSo the next day, I wake up and I feel worse than when I went to bed. I stagger over the window, open up the blinds -- it's pouring down rain outside; ugly day. I go out, get my newspaper, open it up, there's a bad story about me in The New York Times. I pack up my stuff, I go downstairs. My umbrella breaks and I get soaked. So that by the time I'm in the car, I'm sleepy, I'm wet, and I'm mad. (Laughter.) And we start driving, and we just keep on driving -- we're driving, we're driving, we drive -- goes on forever. Hour and a half we're driving.\n\nFinally we get to Greenwood -- although you don't know that you're in Greenwood right away. (Laughter.) It's kind of -- a lot of fields and -- (laughter.) We pull up next to a little field house in a park and I get back out and I get a little more wet and I go inside. And after this hour-and-a-half drive, lo and behold, there are only 20 people inside. (Laughter.) And most of them are wet and don't look like they really want to be there either. (Laughter.)\n\nSo, you know, I'm a professional. I go and shake everybody's hands and I've got kind of a tight smile on my face. \"How do you do? What do you do? Nice to meet you.\" Suddenly I hear this voice behind me, shouting out -- \"Fired up?\" And I'm surprised. I'm scared, almost. (Laughter.) But everybody else acts like this was normal and they all say, \"Fired up!\" \"Ready to go?\" People around me, they all say, \"Ready to go!\"\n\nI don't know what's going on. I look behind me. There is a little woman. She couldn't be more than 5'2\". Watch out -- you're little, too. (Laughter.) Little lady. She's about 50, 60 years old. She dressed like she just came from church. She got a big church hat. And she's smiling at me. She looks at me and she says, \"Fired up!\"\n\nTurns out this woman is a city council member from Greenwood who is famous for her chant. Every event she goes to, she likes chanting. She goes, \"Fired up? \"Fired up!\" \"Ready to go?\" \"Ready to go!\" And she does a little dance while she's doing it. (Laughter.)\n\nSo for the next five minutes, it seems like, she just keeps on saying this little chant. \"Fired up?\" \"Fired up!\" \"Ready to go?\" \"Ready to go!\" And I'm standing there and I'm thinking, this woman is upstaging me. (Laughter.) I don't know what to do. I'm looking at my staff. I'm thinking, when is this thing going to be over? (Laughter.)\n\nBut here's the thing, Ohio. After about a minute or two, I'm starting to feel kind of fired up. (Laughter and applause.) I'm starting to feel like I'm ready to go. (Applause.) So I start joining in the chant, and it's making me feel good. And for the rest of the day, whenever -- we campaigned the whole day. Whenever I saw my staff, I said, \"Are you fired up?\" They said, \"I'm fired up, boss. Are you ready to go?\" And I'd say, \"I'm ready to go.\"\n\nIt just goes to show you how one voice can change a room. (Applause.) And if it can change a room, it can change a city. (Applause.) And if it can change a city, it can change a state. (Applause.) And if it can change a state, it can change a nation. (Applause.) And if it can change a nation, it can change the world. (Applause.) Your voice can change the world. Your voice will get health care passed. Your voice will make sure that the American worker is protected. You can build America. I need your help.\n\nThank you, Cincinnati. Are you fired up?\n\nAUDIENCE: Fired up!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ready to go?\n\nAUDIENCE: Ready to go!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Fired up?\n\nAUDIENCE: Fired up!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ready to go?\n\nAUDIENCE: Ready to go!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Fired up?\n\nAUDIENCE: Fired up!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Ready to go?\n\nAUDIENCE: Ready to go!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love you. Bye-bye. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n1:59 P.M. EDT"

Here is the text of that voicemail message received by Pastor Al Moore in Creola.\n\n\u201cHi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I\u2019m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5000 and $7000 dollars. We will not be fully investigating these claims however we will make a written report. I can be reached by email at albernstein@washingtonpost.com, thank you.\u201d\n\nPastor Moore says he\u2019s baffled about who might be behind the message. He said he sent a response to the email address provided but it came back undeliverable. We also tried the email address with the same result.\n\nJohn Rogers with the Roy Moore campaign says it\u2019s the first he\u2019s heard of this type of robocall. We contacted the Washington Post but it would be highly unlikely that a newspaper would offer thousands of dollars for information, damaging or otherwise. We searched and could not find a record of a \u2018Bernie\u2019 or \u2018Al Bernstein\u2019 who works as a reporter at the Washington Post.\n\nIf any of you have received the same call, please let us know at producers@wkrg.com"

    "text": "According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had \u201cno value\u201d and were \u201clike ISIS,\u201d and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.\n\nNucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 \u2014 $8,832.73 per month \u2014 according to public records.\n\nSixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera \u201chas a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as \u2018n*ggers'\u201d. One of Nucera\u2019s officers \u201cmade numerous recordings\u201d of Nucera that \u201ccontained extremely offensive racist comments\u201d over the course of a year because he was \u201calarmed\u201d by Nucera\u2019s racism, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn\u2019t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police \u201cescalated into a physical struggle,\u201d that both teens \u201cresisted arrest\u201d and that one of the officers used pepper spray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old\u2019s head and slammed it \u201cinto the right side of the metal doorjamb,\u201d according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old\u2019s head make \u201ca loud thud\u201d as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn\u2019t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had \u201cstopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.\u201d The use of force wasn\u2019t reported to the department.\n\nHours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was \u201cf*cking tired\u201d of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cAnd that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,\u201d he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl\u2019s aunt, who was present at the arrest. \u201cFucking nipple hanging bitch. I\u2019m so tired of them, man.\u201d\n\nNucera allegedly said that black people should \u201cstay the fuck out of Bordentown\u201d and referred to the 18-year-old as \u201cfucking little, fucking n****r.\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to \u201cput my hands\u201d on him.\n\n\u201cThese n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cThey should line them all up and mow \u2019em down. I\u2019d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conduct alleged is shocking,\u201d acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.\u201d\n\nNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000."

Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.\n\n\u201cThe Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s decision to approve Rosatom\u2019s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\n\nThe Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.\n\nBut FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee\u2019s decision that Vadim Mikerin \u2014 the main Russian overseeing Putin\u2019s nuclear expansion inside the United States \u2014 was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.\n\nThen-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderEx-AG Holder urges GOP to speak against Trump efforts to 'subvert' election results Tyson Foods suspends Iowa plant officials amid coronavirus scandal Money can't buy the Senate MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.\n\nSpokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn\u2019t comment.\n\nMikerin was a director of Rosatom\u2019s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom\u2019s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom\u2019s new American arm called Tenam.\n\nBetween 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin \u201cdid knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons \u2026 to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,\u201d a November 2014 indictment stated.\n\nHis illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin\u2019s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.\n\nIn evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a \u201cracketeering scheme\u201d that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.\n\n\u201cAs part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,\u201d Agent David Gadren testified.\n\n\u201cMikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,\u201d the agent added.\n\nThe investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinTrump turns his ire toward Cabinet members Ex-deputy attorney general says Justice Dept.

McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife\u2019s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.\n\nIts many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.\n\nThe case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia\u2019s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.\n\nOne of Mikerin\u2019s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to \u201callow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,\u201d agents testified in one court filing.\n\nBringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency\u2019s cap.\n\nBut the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.\n\nThe only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.\n\nBy that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\u2019s approval.\n\nThe final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia\u2019s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.\n\nThe lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, \u201ca former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison\u201d and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.\n\nRonald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin\u2019s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.\n\n\u201cI had no idea this case was being conducted,\u201d a surprised Hosko said in an interview.\n\nLikewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.\n\nFormer Rep.

    "text": "Allegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently. The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago.\n\nMore reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore (who was 39 at the time) and a 14-year-old girl.\n\nA Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation. Lewis\u2019s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called \u201cBeth\u201d had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime.\n\nLewis\u2019s tweet read, \u201cA family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.\u201d\n\nA family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????\n\nIn later tweets, Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her. She had even recorded the phone conversation. Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney\u2019s office. He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up.\n\nJustBrenda, another Twitter user, wrote a response to Lewis\u2019s tweet. She stated that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true. She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses \u201cmake things harder\u201d for real victims.\n\nLewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would \u201cfind out\u201d the truth. He also stated that \u201cJean,\u201d who we can only assume to be the family friend, had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained. According to Lewis, someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call.\n\nBradd Powless, another user on Twitter, told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service.\n\nLewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so, but \u201cJean\u201d didn\u2019t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t blame her with FBI in stories every day,\u201d Lewis added.\n\nIt is important that while these allegations haven\u2019t been proven true or disproven to be true, there may be bits and pieces that are accurate. There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth.\n\nMoore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false.\n\nMoore spoke to Newsweek and stated, \u201cThese allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama special election is only a few weeks away. By December 12th people will be voting, so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false. He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision."

Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for \u201cdozens of fake votes\u201d around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak.\n\nThis is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore \u201cmolesting\u201d a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAll but one of the men were \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants from Mexico, San Salmos, and Puerta Gorda. The last, Marcos Ramos, is a U.S. citizen and faces up to 13 years in prison for election fraud.\n\nHow many other dirty tricks will be exposed?"

Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.\n\nMr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.\n\nAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.\n\nIt is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.\n\n2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or updates from POLITICO and you agree to our privacy policy and terms of service.

It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.\n\nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.\n\nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.\n\nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.\n\nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.\n\nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.\n\nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.\n\nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.\n\nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBut many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTo be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.\n\nIgnoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.\n\nMr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.\n\nMr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.\n\nBut a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:\n\n\u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nIn July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?\u201d\n\nThere are more:\n\n\u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group.\n\nLeaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.\n\nWe are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.\n\nIn our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d\n\nAny of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.\n\nWhat is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nMr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.\n\nWe are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\n\nI sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \"What is truth?\" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows:\n\n\u201cThen say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,\n\nFor the limits of time it steps o'er.\n\nTho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst.\n\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\n\nEternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n"

    "text": "Thousands of government workers are unsure whether or not they will be heading to work on Monday amid uncertainty about how long a government shutdown will last.\n\nUncertainty is the byproduct of a government shutdown, with its impact often hard to predict. However, clues exist in the last shutdown, which was in 2013.\n\nKey services will continue, and many agencies plan to use carryover funds to remain open for several days. But each day the shutdown lasts adds to the pressure on agencies, government employees and civilian contractors, as well as Americans who rely on various federal services.\n\nEmployees considered \u201cessential\u201d will still be required to report to work should the shutdown continue, while those in positions deemed \u201cnonessential\u201d will be barred from coming in.\n\nThe White House on Friday pledged to minimize the effects of the shutdown on the American people, with one official noting that the administration has urged government agencies \u201cto do as much as they can\u201d within the law to maintain operations.\n\nThe push for departments and agencies to utilize existing funding to remain open suggests the Trump administration is hedging its bets that lawmakers can reach a deal and avoid a shutdown the length of one in 2013, which lasted 16 days.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEach federal agency has a contingency plan for a shutdown that is written with help from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. But the impact of the shutdown, which began at midnight when the Senate failed to pass a short-term spending bill, is likely to trickle down gradually as agencies work to mitigate the effects.\n\nAbout half of the Department of Health and Human Services will be placed on furlough. Beneficiaries of programs like Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid will still receive services. The Food and Drug Administration, however, will take a hit, as it will have to halt activities like food safety inspections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will continue \u201cimmediate response work\u201d on influenza, according to White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney Mick MulvaneyMick Mulvaney 'concerned' by Giuliani role in Trump election case On The Money: Senate releases spending bills, setting up talks for December deal | McConnell pushing for 'highly targeted' COVID deal | CFPB vet who battled Trump will lead Biden plans to overhaul agency Consumer bureau vet who battled Trump will lead Biden plans to overhaul agency MORE.\n\nThe National Park Service (NPS) will keep parks open, unlike in 2013, though much of its staff will not report to work. Services such as trash pickup and restroom cleaning will be halted, according to the NPS contingency plan for a shutdown.\n\nCybersecurity will remain a priority during the shutdown, as the government will continue to protect information technology systems, Mulvaney said Saturday at a press conference.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency will largely stay open during the government's closure, and the Labor Department will resume mine safety inspections.\n\nMilitary personnel will be required to show up for work, but will not receive pay for as long as the shutdown lasts. Families of slain military members will experience a halt to death benefits as a result of the shutdown.\n\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel will continue operations, meaning travelers will see both TSA employees and canines operating in airports. The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) management of air traffic control will also continue. Flight delays are not expected and much of the FAA's safety inspections will continue.\n\nThe government closure, a result of Congress\u2019s failed negotiations over a spending bill the last several weeks, has sparked both intraparty battles and fights between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe two parties have each tried to cast blame on the other for the shutdown, with the Republican National Committee invoking the hashtag #SchumerShutdown, referring to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerHouse passes stopgap bill to avoid government shutdown US job openings rise to three-month high McCarthy says he and McConnell back 0 stimulus checks MORE (D-N.Y.).

Both chambers returned to Capitol Hill on Saturday afternoon to work toward a solution."

    "text": "With the unthinkable now cautiously possible, peace between North and South Korea, speculation about President Donald Trump becoming a Nobel Peace Prize winner has begun. If peace in the Korean Peninsula truly happens, the Nobel committee could be left with a difficult choice regarding Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nRecognizing those who helped bring peace to the region would seem like an easy choice, but a decision to give Trump the award could force the Nobel Prize committee into a fierce political debate on whether a man who has openly mocked foreign leaders, launched multiple airstrikes and has threatened war, deserves an award for peace.\n\nBut, if the reconciliation happens, how could Trump\u2019s apparent achievement not be recognized? Donald Trump Jr. said regardless of what unfolds, his father won\u2019t get the credit. \u201cRemember who decides this stuff,\u201d he tweeted. \u201c... The globalist elite would never give him that win.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump. He and Kim Jong Un could both claim the award this year, Trump aides and an oddsmaker from Britain said, according to New York Magazine.\n\nTrump has taken a hard foreign policy stance with North Korea since he took office. With \u201crocket man\u201d quips and threatening words of military strength, peace with the North Korea Leader appeared a lost cause. But fast forward to April 2018, and Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are shaking hands at the Military Demarcation Line, signing the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula and formally ending the Korean war.\n\nAfter the apparently successful meeting between the Korean leaders Trump is now scheduled to meet with the North Korean leader soon, with a location yet to be determined.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\u201cI will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks, we look forward to that,\" Trump said during a Friday press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"We're down to two countries as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is.\"\n\nIf that meeting and Friday\u2019s summit leads to a peace accord, GOP leaders are saying a Nobel Prize would be warranted. Senator Lindsey Graham and former Trump administration official Carl Higbie have already voiced their support for him to win the award.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but if this happens, President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d Graham said on Friday on Fox & Friends.\n\nLaura Ingraham tweeted her support for him to win the award on Friday.\n\n\u201cWhen will we see the headline: \u201cTrump Ends the Korean War\u201d? Unlike Obama, he actually deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Ingraham said.\n\nIf Trump were to win the Nobel Peace Prize, he would not be the first controversial winner. Le Duc Tho became the first and only person to voluntarily refuse a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in negotiating a ceasefire on Vietnam with U.S. Secretary of the State Henry Kissinger. Despite Kissinger\u2019s acceptance of the award, Tho refused to accept because \u201cpeace has not been really restored in South Vietnam.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the Paris agreement on Vietnam is respected, guns are silenced, and peace is really restored in South Vietnam, I will consider the acceptance of this prize,\u201d he said.\n\nOther controversial candidates who have won the award include German journalist Carl Von Ossietzky, who was awarded the prize in 1935 after publishing secret details about the German remilitarization in breach of the Treaty of Versailles before World War II began. The Nazi Party put pressure on the Norwegian Nobel Committee to not grant the award to Ossietzky in 1934, but the committee eventually gave him the award the following year. His win caused two members of the committee to quit, saying they did not want to get involved with what was going on in Germany at the time.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was another controversial win. The Obama administration said it was embarrassing to win the prestigious award his first year in office. The committee said Obama won because of \u201chis extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"\n\nThe first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Wangari Maathai, also had controversy surrounding her selection. Maathai was granted the award for her efforts to empower women living in rural areas in Kenya to reverse deforestation. Her win, however, was slammed by many because of remarks she allegedly made in a Kenyan newspaper, saying that HIV/AIDS were created by Western scientists to try to depopulate Africa.\n\nThere are currently 329 candidates for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, according to the organization\u2019s website. The winners will be announced on December 10."

Although this may not be true, those who have looked into it know that strange anomalies have surrounded the Moon for decades. \u201cContemplation without investigation is the height of ignorance,\u201d a quote attributed to Einstein holds true here. If you actually do some independent research, you might be quite shocked with what you find, especially when it comes to the credibility of the sources.\n\nAs far back as 1970, two well-respected members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, created a hypothesis suggesting that the Moon is a spaceship created by unknown beings. Fast forward to today, and we have former high-ranking members of the military and intelligence agencies sharing their knowledge with regards to strange things that are happening on the Moon. A few examples are listed in the articles linked below.\n\nTake for example Timothy Good, one of the world\u2019s leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies.\n\nGood says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed there were \u201cother\u201d spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this 2013 lecture.\n\nDr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations. The mission discovered water at the Moon\u2019s poles in 1994 (Source: page 16 of 18)(source)(source). But, according to Brandenburg, the Clementine Mission had an ulterior agenda:\n\nDaily In US"

The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama\u2019s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It\u2019s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:\n\nAlong with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama\u2019s \u201cteam\u201d has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation\u2019s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.\n\nHow embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.\n\nThe extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place \u2014 along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC \u2014 is on the list.\n\nThis is no joke, patriots. If Obama\u2019s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren\u2019t your friends. Get out of the house and don\u2019t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves."

    "text": "(CNN) First lady Melania Trump underwent kidney surgery Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington, DC, according to a statement from her office.\n\nTrump had been experiencing an issue with her kidney that her office described as benign but requiring medical attention.\n\n\"This morning, first lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful, and there were no complications,\" the first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement.\n\n\"Mrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere,\" Grisham wrote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump remained in the White House during Melania Trump's surgery. He tweeted just after 5 p.m. Monday that he was heading to hospital to visit his wife in Marine One.\n\n\"Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nHeading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018\n\nTrump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning.\n\nShe is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974.\n\nThe first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady.\n\nTrump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyonc\u00e9, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of \"Scandal.\"\n\nOn May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best . She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady.\n\nBe Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media. The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trump's husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling. In March, the first lady addressed the criticism she has faced by taking up the issue during opening remarks to a meeting she convened at the White House for tech industry leaders from Google, Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others.\n\nJUST WATCHED Melania Trump's popularity jumps in new poll Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Melania Trump's popularity jumps in new poll 02:07\n\n\"I am well-aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\" she said. \"I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right.\"\n\nMelania Trump has also appeared with her husband several times in recent weeks. He was seated in the front row during her Be Best speech, after which he made remarks praising her commitment to helping children, and he was again second to speak, after his wife, during the Military Mothers and Spouses Ceremony on Friday in the White House East Room.\n\n\"She's become a very, very popular first lady. I'm reading that ... They love Melania,\" the President said. A new CNN poll released May 7 had the first lady's favorable rating up 10 points since January to 57%.\n\nThis story is breaking and being updated."

    "text": "A major game-changing incident took place after the National Guard stormed the border to protect the immigration laws and defend citizens from having nearly 2,000 people break into America illegally. America is a land of laws and those wishing to immigrate to the country must follow the proper laws and protocol because people cannot simply walk in without following the rules. Thanks to the National Guard arriving at the border to help lend a hand to the roving tribe of potential illegal immigrants, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were able to arrest 1,600 extra people who were trying to allegedly cross the border illegally.\n\nOut of those 1,600 it\u2019s unknown how many people have criminal records, but they were all about to have a criminal record if they broke into a country illegally. The National Guard helped protect the border and provided the extra manpower that was needed to keep the situation under control. It was reported that the level of criminal activity has slowed due to the agents being present.\n\nThe Washington Examiner provided this information about the border situation: \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have apprehended an additional 1,600 people attempting to illegally enter the country from Mexico since April 15 as a result of the deployment of National Guard troops to the southwest border, CBP and defense officials said Wednesday.\n\nNational Guard officials overseeing the border state deployments said troops helping monitor the international boundary have freed up more border agents to physically guard the border. The result has led to a surge in the amount of criminal activity agents have stopped.\n\nTrending: BUSTED!! Hillary\u2019s Strange Scarf Accidentally Slips Off In Public Exposes What She\u2019s Been Hiding For Months!\n\nThe increased surveillance and communication between guardsmen and border officers also led to CBP intercepting an additional 451 people who were turned back before illegally entering the U.S.\n\nThose numbers could tick up considerably if the 4,000 National Guard troops President Trump approved on April 4 are called on in a future request from CBP.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 775 troops have been deployed and are on the ground providing \u201cdirect support on the ground\u201d in seven sectors assisting law enforcement officers.\n\nTroops are providing support from the air, surveillance back-up, and assistance with infrastructure projects like vegetation clearing and road maintenance, not including to the border wall construction. Another task is to specifically free up agents to leave their desks and get back out to the field. The troops monitoring remote video surveillance systems have then been able to report sightings to a greater field of agents and thus, the number of apprehensions has increased, officials said.\n\n\u201cThose folks are giving us the additional situational awareness in the radio rooms \u2026 which are allowing the Border Patrol agents sitting in those areas to go into the field,\u201d said one National Guard official, who described the addition of the Guard as a \u201cforce-multiplier\u201d for the CBP.\n\n\u201cAs a reminder, these guardsmen are not carrying out law enforcement duties,\u201d an official representing the Texas National Guard said.\n\nGuardsmen have been deployed to the following Border Patrol sectors: 200 to the Rio Grande Valley, 120 to Laredo, 90 to Del Rio, 70 to Big Bend, 110 to El Paso, 135 to Tuscon, and 50 to Yuma.\n\nIn late April, the California National Guard said 200 guardsmen were in training at Camp Roberts and would be deployed in early May. Around 55 troops are already working in those sectors.\n\nThe deployment is funded through the end of fiscal year 2018, September 30. Ronald Vitiello, CBP deputy commissioner, said in April the intent of the mission is for CBP to regain operational control of the border.\u201d\n\nWith the deployment being funded through to the end of the fiscal year of 2018, that means the law should likely be upheld for quite a while until it\u2019s time to renew the budget or the illegal swarm backs off and follows the law.\n\nSome critics are upset that America won\u2019t simply allow people to break into the country, but borders exist for reasons and permit the land to adhere to their laws. Some people want borderless countries, but that would result in absolute chaos much like what\u2019s happening to Germany, Sweden, and London where they have been ravaged by refugees.\n\nWill you comment below and share this to your friends? Will you start a conversation about borders and the proper protocol that it takes to enter a country the legal way.\n\nSource:Viralwdc"

He\u2019s simply doing what he\u2019s paid well to do and wishes others in the biz would too. Since they continue to throw tantrums and trash Trump on a public stage, Russell reached his breaking point and finally fired back hard.\n\n\u201cThis is a business that\u2019s heavily promulgated by people who have a politically liberal bent,\u201d Russell began in his blistering beratement of these overpaid crybabies after what Streep said at the Golden Globes. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge them that.

It\u2019s just, it\u2019s all about the work. And when that\u2019s done, I am done.\u201d\n\nKurt has said recently that \u201cthe last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political,\u201d which he just proved by clearly pointing out that nobody cares what celebrities have to say about politics, and that their obnoxious behavior only shows how unemployable they are.

    "text": "'This Week' Transcript: McKay, Napolitano, Salazar and Allen\n\nTranscript: \"This Week\" with Lamar McKay McKay, Janet Napolitano, Ken Salazar and Thad Allen\n\nTAPPER: Good morning. We'll get to our main story on the oil spill in a moment, but first a breaking news from overnight. A car bomb discovered in New York's Times Square. Police cleared thousands of people from the streets after finding an SUV loaded with propane tanks, gasoline, black powder and a timing device, the makings of what appeared to be a crude car bomb. The situation is now safe, but joining me this morning is Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. And Secretary Napolitano, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about this.\n\nFirst of all, I know that the federal government is treating this as a potential terrorist attack and that you have some evidence, you're dusting for fingerprints. But this attempted attack resembles car bomb attempts in London and Scotland in 2007. How concerned are you that this is not an isolated incident?\n\nNAPOLITANO: Well, right now, we have no evidence that it is anything other than a one-off, but we are alerting state, local officials around the country, letting them know what is going on. The forensics are being done. As leads evolve or develop, they will all be tracked down. This is getting attention. FBI, Department of Homeland Security, New York City police, everybody is on it.\n\nTAPPER: I got to think that Times Square is one of the most surveilled areas in the entire world. How close are we to finding a suspect?\n\nNAPOLITANO: Well, right now, it is heavily surveilled, and as you know, there are cameras all over, and so tape is being reviewed. But traditional forensics are being done in addition to that. Looking for fingerprints, tracking down the vehicle, the license plate number, looking at the timer -- the (inaudible) of the explosive device. Right now it doesn't look like it's all a very sophisticated one, quite frankly, but looking into that. So there is a lot of work that's being done, and then of course other intel being developed, and that will evolve as the day goes on.\n\nTAPPER: How concerned should the American people be?\n\nNAPOLITANO: Well, Times Square I think is now safe, and I believe that right now, we have no information other than it is a one-off. But nonetheless, we are alerting state and local law enforcement, everybody to be on their toes.\n\nTAPPER: OK, great. We'll come back to you and other Obama administration officials in a second. Right now, we're going to turn to our main interview, and that is the President Obama is heading down to the Gulf Coast this morning for his own assessment of the oil spill, a massive slick almost the size of Connecticut. It's making its way to the Louisiana coast, threatening wild life, the environment and the economic livelihood of residents there. Meanwhile, efforts to plug the gush almost a mile below the surface have failed.\n\nJoining me now for an exclusive interview is Lamar McKay, chairman and president of BP America, which owned the well and was leasing the rig that blew up. He joins us from company headquarters in Houston. Mr. McKay, thanks for joining us, and first of all, our condolences to the families of the workers who lost their lives.\n\nMCKAY: Thank you, Jake, and thank you for the opportunity to be here today. This has been a tragic event. As you mentioned, we had 11 people lose their lives. We've had people seriously injured, and we've got an event of enormous proportion that we're dealing with.\n\nTAPPER: OK, BP's plans to stop this leak include an underwater dome that you're trying to build to contain the leak, and a whole other rig to drill a relief well, what is the latest on the situation? The relief well could take up to three months to drill. Where are we in this process?\n\nMCKAY: Jake, let me explain for your viewers exactly what's going on. We've got effectively three fronts of attack that we are aggressively pursuing in partnership with the government. One is effectively stopping the source, stopping the well from flowing. The second one is as -- and these are in parallel -- is to work a containment system, a collection system sub-sea to be able to effectively channel the flow up a pipe and into a processing system that we can control at the surface. Then the third is dealing aggressively, aggressively with the spill offshore and trying to fight that spill offshore, and the fourth is to deal with the -- deal with the, if the oil touches the shore, to deal with the cleanup and deal with the impacts on shore. Those are sorts of the fronts that are under way.\n\nYou mentioned the containment system. We call it the containment dome. That has been fabricated. The engineering is being finalized to get that mobilized and deployed. That will probably be in six to eight days, we'll have that deployed.\n\nMeanwhile, just so you know, we're still working hard, still working hard on the blowout preventer and see if we can actuate this piece of evidently failed equipment. And as you can imagine, this is like doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet, with -- in the dark, with robot-controlled submarines.\n\nTAPPER: The government says currently 5,000 barrels of oil a day are spilling into the gulf. Some experts say it might be five times that, 25,000 barrels of oil a day. How much oil do you think is spilling into the gulf?\n\nMCKAY: Well, the estimates of how much oil is coming out are very difficult because you can't measure in any way accurately, so effectively what we're doing with the help of NOAA and the rest of the government agencies is understand that volume that is inferred essentially by surface expression on the top of the water. So I don't know the volume. The volume uncertainty -- there is a large uncertainty range around the 5,000 barrels.\n\nOur spill response is designed to take that uncertainty into account, and we're responding for that full range of uncertainty with all the resources that we can, in conjunction with the government.\n\nTAPPER: Obama administration officials have expressed in recent days concerns that BP is not doing enough. Other officials have said that you don't have the resources. Should the government take over this operation?\n\nMCKAY: I think we're, as we said from day one, we're throwing every resource that we've got at this, and this is now an industry effort. It's not just a BP effort. It's an effort in conjunction with the government. And I think the partnership that we've got between industry and the government has rallied an effort that is unprecedented in size, and I think that that effort is actually working pretty well. It will continue to be flexed and expanded where it needs to, and I think, you know, the point here is we are doing everything possible that we know of -- and I believe I'm talking about the collective we here -- to control the source first. That's our first priority. While in parallel, fighting the thing offshore as far as -- as far as possible and as effectively as possible, and then dealing with the cleanup and issues and impacts on shore should they occur.\n\nTAPPER: Your company, BP, has a spotty safety record, most horrifically in 2005, an explosion at a refinery in Texas that killed 15 workers; other incidents involving leaks have been blamed on cutting corners on financial reasons. How confident are you that this accident had nothing to do with cutting back on safety to save a buck?\n\nMCKAY: Well, the investigations are going to show the cause of this accident, and we want those investigations to be done. My belief that is that that does not have anything to do with it. I believe we've got a failed piece of equipment. We don't know why it failed yet in this contracted rig, and BOP system will figure that out.\n\nBut let me just tell you, our focus, our focus right now is dealing with the source of the oil, dealing with it on the surface, and dealing with it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs.\n\nTAPPER: Your initial filing to the government, to the Mineral Management Service for 2009 before you drilled on this spot made this assessment, quote, \"An accidental oil spill could cause impact to the beaches. However, due to the distance to shore, 48 miles, and the response capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse impacts are expected. BP Exploration and Production Incorporated has the capability to respond to the maximum extent practicable to a worst-case discharge,\" which you estimated at 300,000 gallons. It's less than that, it's estimated to be 210,000, and yet BP does not seem to have the capability to respond. How can the public trust BP's assessments of risk and how can the public trust anything you guys say?\n\nMCKAY: Well, I think we are responding very, very aggressively. As you may know, we had a response planned, filed for the drilling of this well that incorporates various capability around the Gulf Coast. That spill response plan was activated as soon as this event occurred. It has been extremely aggressive. It will continue to be extremely aggressive, and I believe the response -- this is, you know, we must understand, this is -- this is a very low likelihood but very high impact response -- sorry, incident -- and the response is matching that incident.\n\nTAPPER: I just have a couple more questions. Just a few months ago, a BP executive protested proposed new safety regulations for oil rigs, writing to the government that quote, \"while BP is supportive of companies having a system in place to reduce risks, accidents, injuries and spills, we are not supportive of extensive proscriptive regulations.\" Will BP continue to fight and lobby against safety regulations?\n\nMCKAY: Well, I would characterize the letter you're talking about slightly differently. That letter was in response to the government's request for input on safety regulations that the MMS was looking at. The rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them. So we're not fighting anything about safety. Safety is the number one priority. We're going to figure out what happened here, and that is going to help the MMS and help ourselves and help the industry get safer, so we're not fighting anything about safety.\n\nTAPPER: All right, last question, Mr. McKay. You had several fail/safe mechanisms on this rig, and they all failed. Since you don't yet know what caused this accident, will you stop all operations until you know? How can the American people trust that there won't be another explosion at another BP facility?\n\nMCKAY: Well, we're working in conjunction with the government on understanding everything we can understand as quickly as we can. We're not going to do anything that we think is unsafe. We're doing extra tests on various pieces of equipment to make absolutely sure they will work in the condition they're intended to work in.\n\nWe won't do any work if we don't think it can be carried out safely and without impact. But we are working very closely with the government in trying to understand this and see if there should be any changes quickly.\n\nTAPPER: All right. Lamar McKay, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate your time.\n\nMCKAY: Thank you.\n\nTAPPER: And we're now joined by a powerhouse roundtable. As always, George Will, from the National Action Network, the Reverend Al Sharpton, from HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Bill Maher, former Bush adviser Matthew Dowd, and Katrina vanden Heuvel from The Nation.\n\nThanks, one and all.\n\nGeorge, I've heard some conservative critics say that this oil slick is President Obama's Katrina. Is it?\n\nWILL: No. It might come as a news bulletin to the president himself, but he's not responsible for everything, and bad things happen. This is a reality check for a nation that's ravenous for energy and has to be and always has been. Getting our sources of energy has risks.\n\nThe Exxon Valdez called our attention to the fact that it's very dangerous shipping oil across the surface of the ocean. Since the Exxon Valdez, there have been seven larger tanker spills. You can go up to West Virginia, where 29 miners are being mourned today, and they will tell you about the risks of mining coal. No one says stop mining coal because of this.\n\nTAPPER: Reverend, some critics -- not just from the right -- are saying that the Obama administration was slow. The New York Times editorial board faulted the Obama administration. Is that unfair criticism?\n\nSHARPTON: Well, I think so. I think that when you look at the fact that, first of all, this has been an evolving crisis -- this did not happen -- unlike Katrina, where you had a natural disaster that immediately blanketed the whole area and we were watching it live on television, this got worse over time.\n\nAnd I think that there's evidence that the White House has put out -- I've not talked to them, but I've read this on their Web site -- of how they met each rising crisis with personnel there, cabinet members there, now the president going, unlike George Bush, that said he didn't see the crisis, and we sat there four or five days and watched it live on television. So I think any analogy is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nTAPPER: Bill, I was watching your show Friday night...\n\nMAHER: Morning.\n\nTAPPER: ... and you said, in language more suitable for premium cable...\n\nMAHER: I promise I won't here. They're so nervous about that.\n\nTAPPER: ... that you're surprised President Obama isn't getting more, shall we say, guff for...\n\nMAHER: Exactly.\n\nTAPPER: ... for this crisis.\n\nMAHER: Yes, I think he should. You know, he owns this issue now, because it was only a few weeks ago that he came out for offshore drilling. And I would say philosophically this is -- you know, the problem, I think, a lot of people on the left have with this country and have for many years, is that there's no one who really represents our point of view.\n\nThere's two parties who want to fight the war on terror with an army in Afghanistan. There's two parties who want to drill offshore. Where is the other side on this?\n\nSo, you know, I could certainly criticize oil companies, and I could criticize America in general for not attacking this problem in the '70s. I mean, Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years. We certainly could have.\n\nBut it is very disappointing, I think, for this president to be taking a position, as he had -- and I guess he's backpedaling now on it, I hope. I mean, I hope there's a flip-flop I can believe in there. But...\n\nTAPPER: There's a slogan for you, flip-flops I can believe in.\n\nMAHER: I could believe in that one, and I hope he does.\n\nTAPPER: Matt, where's the public on this issue?\n\nDOWD: Well, I think the public -- I mean, first of all, the public doesn't think there's any equal nature to Katrina and this. I mean, Katrina, obviously, evacuated -- having to evacuate an entire area and what that issue was, was such a different issue than this.\n\nBut I think where the public is on this, if you put this in the context of what happened in West Virginia and the mine disaster and this in context of Katrina, even though it was different, and this in context in many things, I think the public sits there and says, \"Who's in charge? Who is accountable, and who can -- what governmental entity can actually be effective in doing anything?\"\n\nAnd I think that ultimately is where the public is. It's just another example of a fact that we cannot trust the government to do anything that we need them to do, from mines to even a belief (ph) on health care to -- to the oil spill. It's a loss of faith, I think, again, in the government.\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: What we've seen are the risks are too great. Offshore drilling is the problem, not the solution. This is not Katrina, 1,500 dead, hundreds of thousands homeless.\n\nI think more important is to understand that we now need a government that is going to regulate a company, BP, which was a serial abuser of workers and of safety regulations. Just like Massey, we need regulations...\n\nTAPPER: Massey, with the -- with the West Virginia mine.\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: ... tough enforcement -- the mines -- we need a government that understands that. I would also point out that this was the week that for the first time an offshore wind farm was approved. And George Will may not see a future in that, but I believe we need a Manhattan Project, an Apollo Alliance to ramp up public and private investment.\n\nAt the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D. We can do better. We are a nation which should do better, George, and not rely on dirty energy, which just compounds the problem affecting this country and the planet.\n\nTAPPER: Mr. Will, your name has been invoked.\n\nWILL: Well, one in five steps of an approval process has now been taken for the wind farm, vigorously opposed by people who are all in favor of renewable energy elsewhere, because they think it'll spoil their view.\n\nTAPPER: This is the wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts that a lot of people...\n\nWILL: The wind farm on Cape Cod, yes.\n\nTAPPER: ... including the Kennedy family, were fighting tooth and nail.\n\nWILL: Right. And -- and, by the way, wind farms kill a lot more birds daily than are probably going to be killed in this oil spill.\n\nAnd so -- but I'd like to go back to Bill. Could you just explain to me in what sense Brazil got off oil?\n\nMAHER: I believe they did. I believe they, in the '70s, they had a program to use sugarcane ethanol. And I believe that is what fuels their country.\n\nWILL: I think they still burn a lot of oil and have a lot of it offshore.\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: But, George, you're a man who understands there are always alternatives in politics and in science. We can -- you know, why should we be relying on what we are now seeing the risks of?\n\nAnd, by the way, we can do better with existing oil fields. We can get as much from existing oil fields, which the oil companies for profit reasons aren't doing much with. So I just think we have seen the risks and we need to take action. It is just too much to look at what is going on in the gulf and what will happen if it moves into the Arctic.\n\nAnd I agree with Bill. I think President Obama was pandering when he moved to this offshore drilling stance. But I think this White House has the ability, unlike previous White Houses, to understand and see the light and take a different step.\n\nMAHER: And could we have judges fact-check this on Brazil? I don't know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMAHER: ... dreamed that about Brazil.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMAHER: ... and Brazil, let's get back to the United States. I think that Katrina's right. I think that there's a challenge here. And I think that the president and the country has to deal with the reality that we're facing.\n\nAnd I think that the reality is that usually it's not about who's going to speak for the left or right. It's, who's going to be right on these issues? We see what can happen here. Now what do we do about it? And I think that, clearly, a failure to stand up and lead at this point is something that all of us would criticize.\n\nBut I'm not convinced that this president won't. I think he's going down there, he's going to reassess. And I think that we've got to see where that goes and if he goes, right, support him, and I think he will.\n\nBut I think to act like this is Katrina, I think this is the step without -- beyond the realm of a sane discussion.\n\nTAPPER: OK. We're going to take a quick break and come back, and the roundtable will discuss the far less controversial issue -- that's sarcastic -- about immigration law and Florida Governor Charlie Crist's declaration of independence. And later, of course, the Sunday funnies.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOLBERT: There is an impending environmental disaster looming right off our nation's fragile coastline. I'm speaking, of course, about the new wind farm off of Cape Cod. What if it breaks and we have a catastrophic wind spill?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(UNKNOWN): And if the feds won't come in and protect us, then we will come forward and protect ourselves. We -- we have no other choice. We have -- we have a right, Greta, to feel free in our state and to feel safe. And with what's going on, we have many, many people that feel that they are not safe.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Si se puede! Si se puede! Si se puede!\n\nOBAMA: If you are a Hispanic American in Arizona, if you don't have your papers and you took your kid out to get ice cream, you're going to be harassed, that's something that could potentially happen, that's not the right way to go.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: And we're back with our roundtable. As always, George Will, the Reverend Al Sharpton from the National Action Network, the host of HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Bill Maher, Matthew Dowd, former Bush adviser, and Katrina vanden Heuvel of The Nation.\n\nReverend Sharpton, I want to start with you. You're going to be participating in leading a march and a rally and a vigil in Arizona on Wednesday to protest this immigration reform law. What do you think the citizens of Arizona should do with the fact that there is this big illegal immigration problem?\n\nSHARPTON: Well, first of all, I think we need to have real immigration reform from a federal level. The federal government is supposed to set immigration policy, and I think that all of our forces ought to really try to put the pressure there, which is something all of us advocated doing the last two general elections.\n\nTo try and now say that because that has not happened -- and all of us agree it should -- that we're now going to have state law and open the door to racial profiling is what we're objecting to and protesting on Wednesday and have said since the law was signed Friday before last.\n\nAnd this, unlike many of the critics of those of us that protest this, this is not about protecting illegal immigrants. This is about protecting legal citizens. If you are Hispanic or thought to be Hispanic in the state of Arizona, you can be faced (ph) and subjected to an harassment that other citizens should not. That's a violation of equal protection under the law.\n\nWe would not tolerate that to people that look like George if this was a law saying we're looking for people that look Canadian in the state of Vermont. That would be racial profiling.\n\nCitizens that are here, that have -- that have not broken any laws should not be subjected to anything different than any other citizens. It's not about illegal immigrants. It's about legal Latino citizens that should not be targeted, and this law does that.\n\nTAPPER: Matthew?\n\nDOWD: To me, Arizona is a sideshow, and it's symptomatic of a bigger problem. And I don't think this is about the Arizona law. This is about people in a state -- and it's out going on all over the country -- that they see a federal government that's unwilling to enforce a law that's already on the books.\n\nThere is an immigration law on the books. It is illegal to come into this country. Arizona for years and years and years, including under the previous guest, Governor Napolitano, has asked the federal government to enforce the law, which they refuse to do in this -- in this context.\n\nSo it's not about a new law passed. It's about a state says that we think the federal government should enforce the law. They're not enforcing the law, so we're going to enforce the law.\n\nI don't think it's the right response. I think we need the federal government to step up and actually perform an immigration policy. But it's not about Arizona.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: The federal law...\n\nTAPPER: Reverend Sharpton...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: ... does not say that, based on reasonable suspicion of the police, they can go after someone which targets people that are Latino, since you're dealing with a problem with Mexicans coming across the border. The federal law does not say that, does not target that. We agree the federal laws should be looked at, reformed, and enforced, but to say that you're going to sacrifice the civil rights of Latinos and people of color because the federal government has not moved forward, I think, is very irresponsible.\n\nTAPPER: George?\n\nWILL: The Arizona law does not say that there should be racial profiling. And let me tell you what the...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: Well, then why did they just reform it over the weekend...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILL: Let me tell you what the federal law says. \"Every alien 18 years of age and older shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession a certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him.\" That's been federal law for 58 years.\n\nAll that Arizona has done is say we at the state level are going to reinforce the federal law. This is legal. In 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the most liberal circuit court in this country, affirmed the constitutionality of an Arizona law that made it a state crime for employers to hire illegal immigrants. This is not bizarre behavior on Arizona's part.\n\nSHARPTON: The state law does not say -- the state law says that a policeman, under reasonable suspicion -- it did not -- it does not say that in the federal law -- can go and make someone produce and document their citizenship. It does not say what you just read...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: With all due respect, Mr. Will, that is not what that federal law says. And the recognition of that is the state of Arizona's legislature just refined what they said over the weekend. They conceited that we were right and they had to refine it.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILL: ... 50 years of case law refining the concept of reasonable suspicion. This is not a blank slate, Reverend.\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: Mr. Will, why is the law enforcement community in Arizona so deeply divided? I find that an interesting problem.\n\nSHARPTON: Absolutely.\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: You have police chiefs who believe that this will endanger the public safety and security of the state and its citizens. You also have -- these are pragmatic, not moral reasons, even though this bill is state-sanctioned racial profiling and draconian, ugly, mean-spirited -- but you have a $3 billion budget deficit in Arizona. This may well loot that state's treasury as they fight this bill.\n\nYou're going to have economic boycotts, which you disagree with, but you're going to have them, as you had them to push that state to respect Martin Luther King holiday.\n\nAnd finally, you have a situation where the crime rates in Arizona have declined over this last decade, and you have a border guard which has tripled since 2004. The budget has increased money for security. I personally think the security piece is overstated. You want to ensure an orderly flow of people and goods. But you need a humane pathway to citizenship.\n\nTAPPER: Bill, what do you say to Arizona's citizens who are frustrated with the federal government, the law is not being enforced, there is an influx of illegal immigrants -- some of them, obviously not all of them, but some of them are involved in crimes -- what are they supposed to do?\n\nMAHER: Well, I would hope the Constitution of the country is a little more important to them. I know that's asking a lot.\n\nWILL: What constitutional provision does this violate?\n\nMAHER: Well, I mean, nobody's been able to articulate a scenario where the police are stopping people for any other reason than they look Mexican and poor. You know, it kind of reminds me of -- what, was it Potter Stewart on the Supreme Court said about pornography, \"I know it when I see it\"? That seems to be the standard the police are now using with immigration.\n\nTAPPER: I think what...\n\nSHARPTON: There's something called equal protection under the law.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: The law has -- the law has -- to be fair to Governor Jan Brewer of Arizona, she signed an executive order the same day that she signed a law that said that a person's race alone cannot be enough to be reasonable suspicion. There needs to be more than...\n\nSHARPTON: And now she's come back this weekend with something else. So are we going to keep redoing it? I think you'd have to concede that had this not been raised and these protests had not -- they would not themselves be now doing the moonwalk against their own bill.\n\nDOWD: Jake, I think the situation is -- we keep falling back into an Arizona problem. The majority of the country...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: People in Arizona have an Arizona problem.\n\nDOWD: No, the people of this country have an immigration problem.\n\nSHARPTON: I agree.\n\nDOWD: The majority of this country supports what Arizona did, the majority of the country. And two-thirds of people in Arizona support this. Do I think that the Arizona response is the right thing? No. But do I think that it represents a frustration with the federal government, just like what's going on in Wall Street -- the people of this country see Washington -- Democrats and Republicans -- complicit in what we do.\n\nWe don't enforce the laws on Wall Street, so we have a huge problem there. We don't enforce the immigration laws, so states like Arizona react in this way, which I don't think is actually reasonable. But I -- it's reasonable for them to be frustrated with the problem.\n\nTAPPER: Bill?\n\nMAHER: The government intrusion, you know, government power is something that really bothers conservatives, unless it's directed toward people who aren't white. You know, I mean, it does seem like there's some of that going on there. I mean...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Let me just interject. To be fair to conservatives, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, a conservative Republican, and Florida Congressman Connie Mack have had some tough words about parts of this law. Here's McDonnell on Tuesday.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMCDONNELL: I'm concerned about the whole idea of carrying papers and always have to be able to prove your citizenship. That brings up shades of some other regimes that were not particularly helpful to democracy and civil rights.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTAPPER: And Florida Congressman Connie Mack said in a press release, \"This law of frontier justice, where law enforcement officials are required to stop anyone based on reasonable suspicion that they may be in the country illegally, is reminiscent of a time during World War II when the Gestapo in Germany stopped people on the street and asked for their papers without probable cause.\"\n\nGeorge, these are conservative Republicans, very -- I mean, nobody would question Bob McDonnell's bona fides as a conservative. And they are voicing serious concern about this law.\n\nWILL: Yes. To enter Mr. McDonnell's Capitol building or to enter the House office building where Connie Mack works, you have to show a government-issued ID. I mean, this is -- this is synthetic hysteria by a herd of independent minds called our political class right now that has decided to stand up and worry about the Constitution being shredded by measures that have ample history of being sustained against constitutional challenges.\n\nNow, Mr. Maher just said, if I heard him right, that conservatives basically are racists and they like government intrusion only against people who aren't white. I mean, that's the level...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: We'll come to you in one second...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMAHER: Can you -- can you imagine if some of the -- what's going on with the Tea Party rallies, if they were a group of black people, you know, waving guns, coming up armed, talking about how you might -- you know, hinting about how you might have to take matters into your own hands if the government doesn't do what you want? Do you think the reaction in this country would be...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: ... very important point that needs to be addressed. When you say, Mr. Will, that if you go to Mr. McDonnell's building or Congressman Mack's building, you have to show ID, that is the point. Everyone has to show ID. They do not have guards stand there and say, \"Only you that I deem to be reasonably suspect because I think you come from a particular group that may be entering the building to do harm, we're going to search you.\" Everyone is searched.\n\nThis is not the case in the Arizona law. This is not the case of what's going on in the raids with Sheriff Arpaio there. And this is not what we're protesting. If everyone was subjected to that, like the buildings you referred to, there would be no cause for concern.\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: And for George to talk about synthetic hysteria, I mean, your colleague at the Washington Post, Michael Gerson, took serious issue with the column you wrote underneath, saying that this issue is going to sort Republicans and conservatives politically, morally.\n\nI think Latino-bashing, which is what this is, is ultimately political suicide for the Republican Party. I also think...\n\nWILL: Have you read the Democratic immigration bill?\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: I also think that, on the media front, I very much hope that Reverend Sharpton's march in Arizona next week, as the marches on Wall Street demanding accountability for jobs lost and greed, what it's done to this country, get the same attention as six Tea Partiers amassed on a corner get in the media.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMAHER: Let me defend myself, because I was -- just what he said about rephrasing my -- I would never say -- and I have never said, because it's not true -- that Republicans, all Republicans are racist. That would be silly and wrong. But nowadays, if you are racist, you're probably a Republican.\n\nTAPPER: Well, let's leave that...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMAHER: And that is quite different.\n\nTAPPER: Let's leave that topic -- that's a -- that's a whole other roundtable conversation.\n\nBut, George, you did bring up a topic about the Democratic immigration reform bill that I wanted to touch on, because Democrats are now shopping around -- they're trying to find Republican co-sponsors for their immigration reform bill. And it is a tough immigration reform bill. I mean, it does have a path to citizenship, but it also has some tough measures in there.\n\nWILL: It says enforcement first, close the border, later we will worry about comprehensive reform. It could have been written by Republicans.\n\nTAPPER: And, also, part of it is -- and, Bill, you touched on this on your show the other night -- is it has a national ID card. Here's part of the Democratic bill that says, \"The card will possess biometric identifiers in the form of templates that definitively tie the individual user to the identity credential within five years of the date of enactment. This fraud-proof Social Security card will serve as the sole acceptable document to be produced by an employee to an employer for employment verification purposes.\"\n\nThis is the Democratic bill.\n\nSHARPTON: So I'm sure Mr. Will is going to endorse that this morning and make news.\n\nTAPPER: Well, but do you have an issue with that?\n\nSHARPTON: I'm asking him.\n\nTAPPER: But I'm asking you, and it's my show. Do you -- do you -- do you...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Do you have an issue with that?\n\nSHARPTON: I would have some very serious questions about some of the aspects of the Democratic bill, but I'm going to see what ultimately ends up being the Democratic bill. And I'm sure a lot of us in the civil rights community will question parts of it.\n\nWhat I go back to, though, it is interesting to me that those on the right that is headed by Brother Will here has not cheered this on. If he said it could have been written by a Republican, then why didn't he write in his column this morning that he supports it?\n\nWILL: What enforcement of immigration laws do you support?\n\nSHARPTON: You don't answer a question with a question. I'm asking you, would you support the bill...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILL: Let the record show...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILL: Let the record show that the Reverend Sharpton stipulates no enforcement...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: ... answer to my question.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: ... overweighted on enforcement.\n\nSHARPTON: Absolutely.\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: By the way, I think the security card is a non-starter, because you have the coalition of privacy advocates meeting those who are deeply suspicious of government. I don't think that goes anywhere.\n\nBut I do think we need to fight for a comprehensive reform bill, and the Republicans are not signing on anything.\n\nDOWD: OK, so -- so we can give some proper history to this, the first person to really offer and push for comprehensive immigration reform was George W. Bush, which the Democrats and every -- at every place and every time on everything tried to stop. To me...\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: Not Senator Kennedy.\n\nDOWD: ... if we don't -- to me, this conversation is another example why people that tune in and people that think they're going to get an answer from Washington, from Democrats or Republicans, on almost any issue, whether it's protecting the environment, whether it's stopping things on Wall Street, whether it's immigration reform, whether it's enforcement of any law, that is why they're fed up.\n\nNow, we can discount the Tea Party movement and say, \"Oh, they're a bunch of crazies.\" They are symptomatic of a situation in the country which has lost total faith and trust in what goes on...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: We only have -- Katrina, I'm sorry -- we only have 30 more seconds, and, Bill, I do want to give you the last word to respond to George. What should be done to protect the border?\n\nMAHER: I pass.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: There are other movements -- there are other movements outside of Washington. You talked just about the Tea Partiers. The thousands who've massed this past week to protest what Wall Street has done to our economy...\n\nSHARPTON: Absolutely.\n\nVANDEN HEUVEL: ... the immigration rights marches...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: There are clear immigration problems...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSHARPTON: ... for opening the borders, but that does not excuse violating people's civil rights. One does not have to be sacrificed...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTAPPER: Reverend Sharpton, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there.\n\nSHARPTON: And it's your show.\n\nTAPPER: And it's my show. And you guys will talk about Charlie Crist -- we didn't get time to do that. We'll talk about that in the green room, and the roundtable will continue in the green room on abcnews.com. Later, check out our fact checks. \"This Week\" and PolitiFact have joined together to fact check our newsmakers, only on \"This Week.\"\n\nEND."

    "text": "Rising to a New Generation of Global Challenges\n\nMitt Romney\n\nFrom Foreign Affairs, July/August 2007\n\nSummary: Washington is as divided on foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. As the \"greatest generation\" did before us, we must move beyond political camps to unite around bold actions in order to build a strong America and a safer world. We must strengthen our military and economy, achieve energy independence, reenergize civilian and interagency capabilities, and revitalize our alliances. Mitt Romney, Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nTopics:\n\nU.S. policy and politics\n\nNational security and defense\n\nWASHINGTON DIVIDED Less than six years after 9/11, Washington is as divided and conflicted over foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. Senator Arthur Vandenberg once famously declared that \"politics stops at the water's edge\"; today, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declares that our major political parties should carry out two separate foreign policies. The Senate unanimously confirmed General David Petraeus, who pledged to implement a new strategy, as the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Yet just weeks later, the Senate began crafting legislation specifically designed to stop that new strategy. More broadly, lines have been drawn between those labeled \"realists\" and those labeled \"neoconservatives.\" Yet these terms mean little when even the most committed neoconservative recognizes that any successful policy must be grounded in reality and even the most hardened realist admits that much of the United States' power and influence stems from its values and ideals. In the midst of these divisions, the American people -- and many others around the world -- have increasing doubts about the United States' direction and role in the world. Indeed, it seems that concern about Washington's divisiveness and capability to meet today's challenges is the one thing that unites us all. We need new thinking on foreign policy and an overarching strategy that can unite the United States and its allies -- not around a particular political camp or foreign policy school but around a shared understanding of how to meet a new generation of challenges. A GENERATION'S LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP Today's challenges are daunting. They include the conflict in Iraq, the resurgence of the Taliban, and global terrorist networks made even more menacing by the threat of nuclear proliferation. While Iran's leaders relentlessly pursue nuclear weapons capabilities and spout genocidal threats against Israel, the world largely stands silent, unable to agree on effective sanctions even as each day the danger grows. Genocide ravages Darfur even as the world stands frozen. In Latin America, leaders such as Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez seek to reverse the spread of freedom and return to failed authoritarian policies. AIDS and potential new pandemics threaten us in an interconnected world. The economic rise of China and other countries across Asia poses a different type of challenge. It is easy to understand why Americans -- and many others around the world -- feel so much unease and uncertainty. Yet although we face fundamentally different issues today, the United States has a history of rising to meet even greater challenges. Indeed, we need not look to ancient history, but only to the courage and determination of our parents and grandparents to see a stark contrast with the confusion and infighting of Washington today. Just over 60 years ago, we were in the midst of a global war that would take the lives of tens of millions. The outcome was far from certain. General Dwight Eisenhower drafted a short note before the D-day landings at Normandy accepting full responsibility \"in case of failure.\" The invasion did not fail. Yet no sooner had we defeated fascism than we were engaged in a 50-year struggle with communism. Those whom the journalist Tom Brokaw memorialized as \"the greatest generation\" made the tough choices that allowed us to prevail in these struggles. And it was not just our Washington leaders who were decisive. In the 1940s, Americans rationed and saved, and mothers and daughters enlisted to work in factories. Together with the GIs who returned home, they built this country's prosperity and fueled a sense of optimism. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, America pursued learning and innovation to lead the world in space, technology, and productivity -- outcompeting the Soviets and driving them to an economic bankruptcy that matched their moral bankruptcy. In the aftermath of World War II and with the coming of the Cold War, members of \"the greatest generation\" united America and the free world around shared values and actions that changed history. They unified U.S. military and security efforts, creating the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. They rethought U.S. approaches to the world, building the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Peace Corps. They forged alliances, such as NATO, that magnified the power of freedom and created a world trading system that helped launch the greatest expansion of economic and political freedom and development in history. Our times call for equally bold leadership and for a renewed sense of service and shared sacrifice among Americans and our allies around the world.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and U.S. Rep. Peter T. King (R-NY), Ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, issued a joint statement today after the U.S. State Department confirmed that Feisal Abdul Rauf, imam of the proposed \u201cGround Zero Mosque\u201d in New York City, will travel to the Middle East through a taxpayer-funded program of the International Information Programs Bureau at the State Department. Statement by Ros-Lehtinen and King:\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf\u2019s trip to the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is \u2013 a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe State Department\u2019s selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administration\u2019s policy and funding priorities.\u201d\n\n\n\nBackground: In an interview televised just 19 days after the attacks against America on September 11, 2001, Abdul Rauf cast blame for them on the U.S. He called the attacks \u201ca reaction against the U.S. Government politically\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say that the United States deserved what happened, but United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened\u2026 We have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world. In fact, in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA.\u201d\n\n\n\nNote: On Monday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called Abdul Rauf \u201ca distinguished Muslim cleric\u201d and noted that the State Department \u201csend[s] people from Muslim communities here in this country around the world to help people overseas understand our society and the role of religion within our society.\u201d\n\n\n\n######"

    "text": "NEW YORK \u2013 The planned mosque and Islamic center blocks from ground zero got a new boost Wednesday from a coalition of supporters that includes families of Sept. 11 victims.\n\nNew York Neighbors for American Values rallied for the first time at a municipal building near ground zero.\n\n\"I lost a 23-year-old son, a paramedic who gave his life saving Americans and their values,\" Talat Hamdani said, and supporting the Islamic center and mosque \"has nothing to do with religion. It has to do with standing up for our human rights, including freedom of religion.\"\n\nAmong the nearly 2,800 people killed when the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001 were more than 30 Muslims, she noted.\n\nOpponents of the Islamic center project argue it's insensitive to the families and memories of Sept. 11 victims to build a mosque so close. Supporters cite freedom of religion.\n\nThe new coalition was started by members of 40 civic and religious organizations that \"spontaneously called each other, because we had the feeling that something very negative was happening,\" said Susan Lerner, executive director of the New York office of the watchdog group Common Cause.\n\nThe controversy was triggered by \"irresponsible politicians\" using it as an election issue, she said. Names mentioned at the rally included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nGingrich has suggested that building the mosque near ground zero is akin to putting a Nazi sign \"next to the Holocaust Museum.\" Reid has broken ranks with President Barack Obama by saying he thinks the mosque should be built elsewhere.\n\nCoalition members are now contacting officials, asking them to support the project as a reflection of religious freedom and diversity, and the rejection of \"crude stereotypes meant to frighten and divide us.\"\n\nThey plan a candlelight vigil near ground zero on Sept. 10, the eve of the ninth Sept. 11 anniversary.\n\n\"This is not just about Muslims; this is about who we are as Americans,\" said Lerner, adding that to oppose the Islamic center is \"a slippery slope. There will always be people who are offended standing next to people who are different from others.\"\n\nRabbi Arthur Waskow, director of New York's Shalom Center, said the project will show the world a form of Islam that espouses peace \u2014 not the Islam of the terrorists.\n\n\"It is right; it is wise to build it,\" he told hundreds of people gathered under the arches of Manhattan's Municipal Building, a short walk from ground zero.\n\nSeveral coalition members noted that the mosque site's developer, Sharif el-Gamal, modeled it after the Jewish Community Center on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It serves anyone who wishes to participate, they said, and so will the Muslim center near ground zero."

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nWOLF BLITZER, HOST: Let's begin our questioning.\n\nRight now Tom Fahey of the New Hampshire Union Leader with the first question.\n\n\n\nTOM FAHEY, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER: Thanks, Wolf.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, I wanted to start by asking you a question on which every American has formed an opinion.\n\n\n\nWe have lost 3,400 troops, civilian casualties are even higher, and the Iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country. Knowing everything you know right now, was it a mistake for us to invade Iraq?\n\n\n\nMITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS: Well, the question is, kind of, a non sequitur, if you will. What I mean by that -- or a null set -- that is that if you're saying let's turn back the clock and Saddam Hussein had opening up his country to IAEA inspectors and they'd come in and they'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction, had Saddam Hussein therefore not violated United Nations resolutions, we wouldn't be in the conflict we're in.\n\n\n\nBut he didn't do those things, and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in.\n\n\n\nI supported the president's decision based on what we knew at that time.\n\n\n\nI think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n\nBy the way, Harry Reid was wrong. We did not lose the war in Iraq. And that's not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm's way.\n\n\n\nWe did, however, not do a great job after we knocked down Saddam Hussein and won the war to take him down and his military.\n\n\n\nAnd at this stage, the right thing for us to do is to see if we could possibly stabilize the central government in Iraq so that they can have stability, and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nNot to do that adds an enormous potential risk that the whole region could be embroiled in a regional conflict. BLITZER: Governor, thank you, but the question was, knowing what you know right now -- not what you knew then, what you know right now -- was it a mistake for the United States to invade Iraq?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, I answered the question by saying it's a non- sequitur. It's a non -- null set kind of question, because you can go back and say, \"If we knew then what we know now, by virtue of inspectors having been let in and giving us that information, by virtue of if Saddam Hussein had followed the U.N. resolutions, we wouldn't be having this discussion.\"\n\n\n\nSo it's a hypothetical that I think is an unreasonable hypothetical.\n\n\n\nAnd the answer is: We did what we did. We did the right thing based on what we knew at that time. I think we made mistakes following the conduct or the collapse of Saddam's government.\n\n\n\nFAHEY: Mayor Giuliani, same question to you. Knowing what you know right now, was it a good decision?\n\n\n\nRUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: Absolutely the right thing to do. It's unthinkable that you would leave Saddam Hussein in charge of Iraq and be able to fight the war on terror.\n\n\n\nAnd the problem is that we see Iraq in a vacuum. Iraq should not be seen in a vacuum. Iraq is part of the overall terrorist war against the United States.\n\n\n\nThe problem the Democrats make is they're in denial. That's why you hear things like you heard in the debate the other night, that, you know, Iran really isn't dangerous; it's 10 years away from nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nIran is not 10 years away from nuclear weapons. And the danger to us is not just missiles. The danger to us is a state like Iran handing nuclear weapons over to terrorists.\n\n\n\nSo it has to be seen in that light. And we have to be successful in Iraq.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator McCain, arguably going to war is the most important decision a member of the Senate can make.\n\n\n\nDid you read the national intelligence estimate, which included all the caveats on whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?\n\n\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I did not read that particular document. I received hundreds of briefing, tens and hundreds of hours of study and background and information on it. And the fact is that the sanctions were breaking down. The sanctions were not going to hold. We had a multi-billion dollar scandal in the form of oil for food.\n\n\n\nThe fact is that Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction before on his own people and on his enemies. And if he'd gotten them again, he'd have used them again. That was his commitment and his belief, that he was going to. And we did the right thing.\n\n\n\nThe problem was the mismanagement of the conflict.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nSenator Brownback, you're also a member of the United States Senate. Did you read that classified national intelligence estimate?\n\n\n\nSEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R), KANSAS: I don't remember that report. I had a number of briefings and I held a number of committee hearings. At that time, I was chairing the Middle East Subcommittee on Foreign Relations. And we held hearings on this topic and what was taking place and what Saddam was doing.\n\n\n\nBut the issue is that we've got to put forward, now, a political plan. And that's something I'm going to introduce tomorrow, a political plan to create a three-state solution in Iraq: a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shia state. Because Iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces. And that's what we've lacked is a political plan to get us moving forward in success.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nGovernor Gilmore, let me go to you. You chaired this commission. Do you think it was appropriate that members of Congress would authorize the president to go to war without reading that national intelligence estimate?\n\n\n\nJIM GILMORE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA: You know, I think the people who are in Congress who are responsible for sending this country to war, with the enormous dangers that it has geopolitically and strategically, ought to read at least that kind of material. I know they get a lot of stuff and they can't read everything.\n\n\n\nBut you know what, Wolf? I think the true business is this: The interests of the United States is in creating as much stability as possible in the Middle East. There is a very great danger to this country: our interests in Israel, our interests in energy and in other ways. There is a giant danger of the Middle East becoming an unstable place.\n\n\n\nSaddam Hussein was unstable, and so taking him out was good there. But we certainly didn't anticipate the further instability that was to come after.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to bring all of you in, but I want to go to Scott Spradling of WMUR for the next question.\n\n\n\nSCOTT SPRADLING, WMUR-TV: Thanks, Wolf.\n\n\n\nSenator McCain, we've just spent a few minutes looking back. I'd ask you to look forward now, if you will.\n\n\n\nSince June 1st there have been at least 17 confirmed deaths of American soldiers in Iraq. Approximately 100 U.S. troops are dying there every month. If our top military commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, reports back to Congress this September that the surge hasn't significantly improved the situation on the ground, what then?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: Well, let me say, first of all, I know how frustrated and saddened all Americans are. This morning I was with the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfeboro, who sacrificed his life. And our hearts and our sympathy goes out to all those who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict.\n\n\n\nI (inaudible) think this strategy needs to be given a chance to succeed. We haven't barely gotten the fifth brigade over there, which is part of this strategy.\n\n\n\nI am convinced that if we fail and we have to withdraw, they will follow us home. It will be a base for Al Qaida. And we will be facing greater challenges and greater sacrifices than that already made by Matthew Stanley and his family.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that this will become a base for terrorism, there will be chaos in the region. And when Senator Clinton says this is Mr. Bush's war, that this is President Bush's war -- when President Clinton was in power, I didn't say that Bosnia, our intervention there was President Clinton's war. When we intervened in Kosovo, I didn't say it was President Clinton's war.\n\n\n\nWhat Senator Clinton doesn't understand that presidents don't lose wars. Political parties don't lose wars.\n\n\n\nNations lose wars, and nations lose the -- have the consequences of failure.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: We must succeed in this conflict.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: ... the question was, if General Petraeus says...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n... it's not working so far in September, what do you do then?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: Then you have to examine the options.\n\n\n\nAnd I'll tell you the options: One is the division that Sam described. You would have to divide bedrooms in Baghdad because Sunni and Shia are married to each other. You have 2 million Sunni and 4 million Shia living in Baghdad together.\n\n\n\nYou would have to -- you withdraw to the borders and watch genocide take place inside Baghdad. You watch the destabilization of Jordan. You see further jeopardy of Israel because of the threats of Hezbollah and Iranian hegemony in the region.\n\n\n\nAll of the options I could run through with you. My friend, none of them are good. That's why we must succeed and give it a chance to succeed.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nNow, let me bring in Governor Thompson.\n\n\n\nGo ahead, same question to you: If General Petraeus says it's not working in September, what should the U.S. do then?\n\n\n\nTOMMY THOMPSON, FORMER HHS SECRETARY: The first thing the president should do is demand the al-Maliki government to vote as to whether or not they want the United States to stay in Iraq. We've been there four years. Give the government the responsibility of voting.\n\n\n\nIf they vote \"yes,\" how are they going to help us win this war? If they vote \"no,\" we should redeploy our forces outside.\n\n\n\nSecondly, there are 18 territories in Iraq, geographically defined. Those 18 territories, just like 50 states in America, should elect their state leaders. And if they do so, the Shiites will elect Shiites, Sunnis will elect Sunnis, Kurds will elect Kurds. And you know something? People will go to those particular territories, and you get rid of this civil war internecine.\n\n\n\nNumber three...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right...\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: ... I would like to have the oil revenue proceeds -- very quickly -- oil revenue proceeds split: one-third to the federal government, one-third to the states, and one-third to every man, woman and child. And that will get everybody a stake in their country.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Let me bring in Congressman Duncan Hunter.\n\n\n\nCongressman, if it's not working at that point, how much longer should the United States stay?\n\n\n\nREP. DUNCAN HUNTER (R), CALIFORNIA: Well, Wolf, you know, I read that NIE report, and I held briefings before we made the vote to go in and invited everybody, Democrat and Republican, to get the classified information.\n\n\n\nAnd this depends -- the turnover of the security apparatus depends on one thing: reliable Iraqi forces.\n\n\n\nYou've got 129 Iraqi battalions. We've trained them up. We've got a lot of them in the fight. Over the next three to four months, we need to get them all in the fight, get them that combat capability. When they're combat-hardened, we rotate them in, we displace American heavy combat forces off that battlefield, and Americans come home. And, Wolf...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: ... I can tell you, as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the last four years, I have the credentials to leave Iraq the right way.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Congressman Ron Paul, how much longer should the United States stay in Iraq?\n\n\n\nREP. RON PAUL (R), TEXAS: The sooner we come home, the better. If they declare there's no progress in September, we should come home. It was a mistake to go, so it's a mistake to stay.\n\n\n\nIf we made the wrong diagnosis, we should change the treatment. So we're not making progress there and we should come home.\n\n\n\nThe weapons weren't there and we went in under U.N. resolutions. And our national security was not threatened. We're more threatened now by staying.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor Huckabee, do you have confidence in the government of Iraq...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n... the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, that he's going to do what needs to be done?\n\n\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: I think there's some real doubt about that, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBut I want to remind all of us on this stage and the people in the audience that there's a reason that this is such a struggle. And I think we miss it over here in the West.\n\n\n\nToday's the birthday of Ronald Reagan. We all would believe that Ronald Reagan is the one who ended the Cold War and Ronald Reagan is the one who helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\nBut there's a group of people who don't believe that, and that's the Taliban. They believe they brought about the demise of the Soviet Union because of the way they fought in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nAnd what I want to just mention is that it is not the size of the dog in the fight, it is the size of the fight in the dog. And we underestimate -- grossly underestimate how fierce this dog is and how determined they are to destroy every last one of us.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nCongressman Tom Tancredo, what do you say?\n\n\n\nREP. TOM TANCREDO (R), COLORADO: I'll tell you this, that if it comes to that point in that time that you described, that the surge is apparent that it is not working, I did support it. I hope to God it does work. I hope I'm wrong. I hope we pacify Iraq.\n\n\n\nHowever, if it is apparent that we cannot, then we have to do and tell the Iraqis the exact same thing that Benjamin Franklin said when he came out of the convention in 1787 and somebody said to him, \"Dr. Franklin, what have you given us?\" And he said, \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"\n\n\n\nIt is exactly that time and it is exactly that thing that we have to say to the Iraqi government: \"We have given you this. We bought it with our blood and sweat. It is now up to you to keep it.\"\n\n\n\nAnd I want the Iraqis to be in fact patrolling Baghdad. If they need vehicles, you let them have the vehicles. But I want them patrolling their city and putting their lives at risk.\n\n\n\nThen we move out.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nI want to go to the next question. I want to go back to Tom.\n\n\n\nTom, go ahead.\n\n\n\nFAHEY: Senator Brownback, President Bush has stated that states that sponsor terrorism are no different than terrorists themselves. Yet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently met with Iranian officials to discuss security in Iraq. Iran is a known support of Hezbollah, Hamas.\n\n\n\nDid President Bush make the right call in opening a dialogue with Iran?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: I think he made a right call on saying that about terrorist states, particularly Iran. But I think we have to at times talk with them in different situations.\n\n\n\nLike, before we went into Afghanistan, we talked with Iran. It wasn't we were negotiating. We didn't open up formal diplomatic relations and we shouldn't.\n\n\n\nIran is the lead sponsor of terrorism. Ahmadinejad just this past week called for the destruction of Israel, continues to call for attacking of the United States.\n\n\n\nOn Iraq, I think we need to talk with them. I think we have to confront them aggressively for what they are, which is the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world. I think we need to push the sanctions forward more aggressively. I think we need to work with the labor union movement that's developing inside of Iran. You had a bus driver strike that recently took place.\n\n\n\nAnd I think we have to show that purpose and resolve, that we're going to confront these guys and we're going to stand with our allies like Israel, we're going to stand against them oppressing and pushing us, and trying to fund terrorists against us.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nCongressman Hunter, let me bring...\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: Senator, if you don't mind.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Excuse me, Senator.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: That's OK.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Congressman Hunter, let me bring you back in. Do you agree with Senator Brownback that President Bush made the right decision in opening a direct dialogue with Iran?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: With two conditions. And I think that you do have a dialogue with everybody, whether they're adversaries or friends.\n\n\n\nThe two conditions are: Number one, they are moving deadly equipment across the border that is killing Americans in Iraq.\n\n\n\nWe have license to utilize anything that we want to use: special operations, intelligence, whatever it takes to stop that deadly equipment from moving across the border and hitting Americans in Iraq. And we don't give that up with these talks.\n\n\n\nSecondly, they've got about 1,000 centrifuges now working, enriching the material that can make, at some point, a nuclear device. The United States reserves the right to preempt, and we may have to preempt that nuclear weapons program. We cannot allow them to have a nuclear device.\n\n\n\nWith those two caveats, talk to your enemies.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: If it came down to a preemptive U.S. strike against Iran's nuclear facility if necessary, would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: I would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges.\n\n\n\nWhen the Osirak reactor was hit in '86, when the six F-18s came over the horizon and knocked that out, they didn't need anything but conventional weapons.\n\n\n\nProbably it's going to take a little more than that. I don't think it's going to take tactical nukes.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: What do you think, Mayor? Do you think, if you were president of the United States and it came down to Iran having a nuclear bomb, which you say is unacceptable, you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Part of the premise of talking to Iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the United States that they have nuclear power. I think it could be done with conventional weapons, but you can't rule out anything and you shouldn't take any option off the table.\n\n\n\nAnd during the debate the other night, the Democrats seemed to be back in the 1990s. They don't seem to have gotten beyond the Cold War. Iran is a threat, a nuclear threat, not just because they can deliver a nuclear warhead with missiles. They're a nuclear threat because they are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism and they can hand nuclear materials to terrorists.\n\n\n\nAnd we just saw it just last week in New York, an attempt by Islamist terrorists to attack JFK airport; three weeks ago, an attempt to attack Fort Dix.\n\n\n\nThese are real problems. This war is not a bumper sticker. This war is a real war.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Let me bring Governor Gilmore in.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if that's what it takes to go deep underground and destroy those Iraqi facilities?\n\n\n\nGILMORE: One of the central problems of the Middle East is the desire for Iran to dominate that portion of the world, because of what they are doing. And that is why I believe that they are seeking this kind of nuclear capacity. That is one of the reasons why we are, in fact, in Iraq.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why our soldiers, when they fight and die there, are in fact serving the interests of the United States. Nobody ought to have any doubt about that.\n\n\n\nWith respect to Iran, the policy I would follow would be dual.\n\n\n\nNumber one, we need to work with our European allies in order to put in appropriate sanctions. We need to communicate directly with the Iranians that we are going to offer them an opportunity to work with us.\n\n\n\nBut we are also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable; they need to understand it. And all options are on the table by the United States in that instance.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right. Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, I want to get you on the record. Do you agree with the mayor, the governor, others here, that the use of tactical nuclear weapons, potentially, would be possible if that were the only way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: You don't take options off the table, but what you do is stand back and say, \"What's going on here?\" You see what's happening in Sudan and Afghanistan, in Iraq and Iran. All over the world, we're seeing the same thing happening, and that is people are testing the United States of America. And we have to make sure they understand that we're not arrogant; we have resolve. And we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty.\n\n\n\nFor that to happen, we're going to have to not just attack each one of these problems one by one, but say, how do we help move the world of Islam so that the moderate Muslims can reject the extreme?\n\n\n\nAnd for that to happen, we're going to have to have a strong military and an effort to combine with our allies in such a way, we combine for an effort to help move Islam toward modernity.\n\n\n\nThat's what we're going to have to do, instead of looking at each theater one by one and saying, \"We'll bomb here, we'll attack here, we'll go to Sudan.\"\n\n\n\nI watched the Democrats...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: ... they don't think there's a war on terror.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: There's a war going on, and we need a broad response to make sure that these people have a different vision.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nAll of you are going to have an opportunity to weigh on all of these questions as well.\n\n\n\nIf you're hearing some sounds out there, it's lightning here in Manchester, New Hampshire. Those are the crackling sounds that you're hearing.\n\n\n\nLet's go back to Scott.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: Thanks, Wolf.\n\n\n\nCongressman Tancredo, let's talk immigration.\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: OK.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: You oppose the immigration reform compromise, calling it, quote, \"the worst piece of legislation to come down the pike in a long time.\" Just this morning in Manchester, you vowed to oust any senator who supports the bill, including possibly New Hampshire's senior Senator Judd Gregg, who's undecided, and says to your comments that you are part of the know-nothing wing of the political spectrum.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the president says his plan is the last best chance for serious immigration reform.\n\n\n\nHe's criticized conservatives for being obstructionists.\n\n\n\nWith that tension at stake, if this becomes law, what are the consequences for the country?\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: They are incredible, and they are disastrous.\n\n\n\nAnd that is exactly why I have said what I've said, and that is why I have consistently tried to impress upon the American public the seriousness of this issue.\n\n\n\nWe're not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country. We're not just talking about that.\n\n\n\nWe're talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation: whether or not we will actually survive as a nation.\n\n\n\nAnd here's what I mean by that.\n\n\n\nWhat we're doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces.\n\n\n\nWe are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the English language, something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation.\n\n\n\nWe are becoming a bilingual nation. And that is not good.\n\n\n\nAnd that is the fearful part of this. The ramifications are much, much more significant than any that we've been discussing so far.\n\n\n\nAnd so, yes, I have said dramatic things. And, yes, I am willing to do whatever is necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation. And that includes go after any Republican that votes for it, because the Republicans can stop this.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nMayor Giuliani, what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by President Bush goes through?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: The problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose. It's a typical Washington mess. It's everybody compromises -- four or five compromises.\n\n\n\nAnd the compromises leave you with the following conclusion: The litmus test you should have for legislation is, is it going to make things better? And when you look at these compromises, it is quite possible it will make things worse. The organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country.\n\n\n\nThey should have a tamper-proof I.D. card. It should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are, why they're here, make sure they're not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose, and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database.\n\n\n\nWe can do that. Credit card companies...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: ... take care of data that is greater than that.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\nI want to get to Senator McCain in a moment, but first, Governor Romney, Senator McCain has accused you of flip-flopping on this issue, in effect.\n\n\n\nYesterday in Miami, he said the following: \"Pandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing. And doing nothing is silent amnesty.\"\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to Senator McCain?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, he's my friend. He campaigned for me two times. I consider him a friend. I'm not going to make this a matter of personal politics. It's an issue that's way too important for that.\n\n\n\nMy view is that we should enforce our immigration laws.\n\n\n\nAnd this bill, unfortunately, has at least one provision that's a real problem. It's the Z visa.\n\n\n\nAnd what it allows is people who have come here illegally to stay here for the rest of their lives -- not necessarily as citizens; they have to wait 13 years to become citizens. That's not the point.\n\n\n\nThe point is: Every illegal alien, almost every one, under this bill, gets to stay here. That's not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here, join with family members, bring skill and education that we need.\n\n\n\nIt's simply not fair to say those people get put ahead in the line of all the people who've been waiting legally to come to this country.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right, Senator McCain, this is your chance. I'd like you to respond as someone who is the co-author of this legislation.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: Well, first of all, I agree with Judd Gregg. He's a great senator.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nSecond of all, Rudy, you just described our legislation, so I'd be glad to have further conversation with you, because it does account for people who are here illegally.\n\n\n\nIt does have an employment verification system. And it weeds out those who shouldn't be here, and it gives others a chance to remain in this country.\n\n\n\nLook, this is a national security issue, first and foremost. Ever since 9/11, it's a national security issue.\n\n\n\nPeople came to Fort Dix, New Jersey, from across our southern border and tried to kill our soldiers.\n\n\n\nFor us to do nothing is silent and de facto amnesty.\n\n\n\nWhat we have done is what you expect us to do, my friends, and that's come together with the president of the United States, the leader of our party, Democrat and Republican, conservative Republicans like Jon Kyl, Johnny Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Trent Lott, and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem.\n\n\n\nAnd it is a serious national security problem.\n\n\n\nWe need to act, my friends. And if someone else has a better idea, I'd love to have them pursue -- give it to us.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nHold on.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: That can get...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: ... a better idea!\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: That will get the support of enough people so that we can pass legislation.\n\n\n\nThis isn't the bill that I would have written, but it does...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right. Thank you.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: ... it does satisfy our national security challenges, which are severe and intense. And we cannot 12 million people washing around America illegally, my friends. (CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: And I hope you'll examine the legislation.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: And I hope we can move forward with it. And we can make it better.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: But it's our job to do the hard things...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Mayor, go ahead.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: ... not the easy things.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I've read the 400 pages. And this is part of the problem in Washington: They say things and then it's not in the legislation.\n\n\n\nThere are four or five different methods of identification, not one.\n\n\n\nIt does not provide information about who exited the United States. Now, tell me how you're going to figure out who's in the United States if you can't figure out who's left the United States.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, it doesn't provide for a uniform database. Many countries have this. The United States doesn't have it.\n\n\n\nOn September 11th, when we tried to figure out who was in this country, it took weeks to figure out who were the right people and who weren't, because there isn't such a database. And that is a fatal flaw in this legislation. And wishing it away doesn't make it possible.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor Romney, what would you do with the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are, right now, in this country?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, one is to enforce the law as it exists. The law that was passed in 1986...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThe law passed in 1986 asked for us to secure the border and said also to put in place an employment verification system.\n\n\n\nNeither one of those was done. So let's make sure that we enforce the law as it exists.\n\n\n\nAnd if you want to improve this bill, well, one thing you could do to make it better is to take that Z visa and make it temporary instead of a permanent right to stay in America. That's simply just not fair.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I want to stay on immigration. Everybody's going to have a chance to weigh in. But let's go back to Tom for another question on immigration.\n\n\n\nFAHEY: Congressman Hunter, whether we like it or not, in cities across America, counties across America, including your district in San Diego, illegal immigrants are doing jobs that American citizens don't want, working on farms, in hotels, restaurants.\n\n\n\nIf you have your way and they all leave this country, who's going to fill those jobs?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: Well, first, I disagree with that premise, because when they made the sweep on the Swift plants -- those were the meat- packaging plants in Iowa; took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago -- there were American citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour.\n\n\n\nAnd let me tell you, this is a disastrous bill. And John McCain is right in saying that this is a national security issue. And it is: border enforcement.\n\n\n\nThen the Hunter bill, which was signed by the president on the 26th of October, mandating 854 miles of double fence -- not that scraggly, little fence you show on CNN all the time, Wolf, that people get across so easily.\n\n\n\nIf they get across my fence, we sign them up for the Olympics immediately.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nWe've got a big fence.\n\n\n\nBut 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed. Homeland Security has a billion bucks, cash on hand. It's been six months, and they've done 11 miles.\n\n\n\nSo this administration has a case of the slows. And I think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time, put the two together, and the Bush-McCain-Kennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike.\n\n\n\nIt's a bad bill.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nSenator Brownback, what do you say about this notion of a pathway toward citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now? Under what circumstances would you let them begin that path?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: I don't think you create any new paths to citizenship. But I also think you allow them to be able to use paths that they would currently qualify for, and to be able to get in the back of the line. And that's part of leadership and getting something resolved.\n\n\n\nI think, you know, we can go on a lot of slogans here. And I've been around this issue for a while. I was in Congress in 1994, elected then. We did the first immigration bill I was involved in then in 1996.\n\n\n\nYou know what? That was an enforcement-only bill in 1996. And we had 7 million undocumented here in the country then. We're at 12 million to 20 million now.\n\n\n\nThe point of saying that -- and my colleagues and people up here, everybody is concerned that we get something done and get something right.\n\n\n\nI think if you do exterior enforcement, border enforcement, you do aggressive interior enforcement, and then you work on a comprehensive solution interior, that's something that a lot of people are going to be upset with but that can work and move us forward. And it's better than not doing anything.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. So you support this pending compromise legislation?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: If we can hold together those things in it. Those things have to be in it.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You're with Senator McCain.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: If those things are in it.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: What about you, Governor Thompson?\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: Wolf, the first thing you have to do is you've got to secure the border. Securing the border is going to allow everything else to follow.\n\n\n\nBut unless you secure the border, it is not right to give 12 million individuals who have illegal rights in this country status before that border is protected.\n\n\n\nThere should be no amnesty. And this bill, no matter how you cover it, is an amnesty bill.\n\n\n\nAnd the people in this country do not believe in that bill. And they believe very much that the best hope for us to have a secure border, just like Congressman Hunter has been talking about and every other Republican up here.\n\n\n\nHave a secure border, then move on. But don't do it the other way. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nCongressman Paul, I want you to weigh in on this as well. I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- you voted to support that 700-mile fence along the border between the United States and Mexico. Did you?\n\n\n\nPAUL: I did.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: What about Canada? Is there a need for a similar fence along the border between...\n\n\n\nPAUL: No.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: ... the United States and Canada?\n\n\n\nPAUL: No, because that bill -- probably the fence was my weakest reason for doing that, but for other reasons, to enforce the law was important. And border security is important.\n\n\n\nAnd we talked about amnesty, which I'm positively opposed to.\n\n\n\nBut one thing that has not been mentioned here, which I think is very, very important: If you subsidize something, you get more of it. So we subsidize illegal immigration. We reward it by easy citizenship, either birthright or amnesty. But we force our states and our local communities to pay for the health care, to pay for the education. Why wouldn't they bring their families?\n\n\n\nAnd because of our economic conditions, we do need workers. But if we had a truly free-market economy, the illegal immigrants would not be the scapegoat. We would probably need them, and they would be acceptable. But because of economic conditions, they have become the scapegoat.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: The other night, Sunday night, I asked the eight Democratic presidential candidates whether or not they thought English should be the official language of the United States. Only one of them said English should be the official language of the United States.\n\n\n\nIf there's someone here who doesn't believe English should be the official language of the United States, please speak up right now.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: I think it's fine.\n\n\n\nI would like to remind you that we made treaties with Native Americans such as the Navajos in my state, where we respect their sovereignty and they use their native language in their deliberations. It's not a big deal. But Native Americans are important to me in my state.\n\n\n\nEverybody knows that English has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder. That is obvious.\n\n\n\nAnd part of our legislation, by the way, is a requirement to learn English.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, 30 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never came across our borders, my friends. They overstayed their visas. That's why it has to be a comprehensive approach.\n\n\n\nAnd I'm proud of the support of the president and his brother, Governor Jeb Bush, who was governor of the state of Florida. People who have to deal with this issue every day understand we have to act, my friends.\n\n\n\nAnd we can have our own ways to improve it. But if we don't address this issue, we are going to pay a heavy price. Because something bad could happen when 12 million people are in this country illegally, 2 million of them having committed serious crimes.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I see people raising their hands.\n\n\n\nBut the question was, I'd only like those to speak up who believe that English should not necessarily be the official language of the United States.\n\n\n\nIs there anyone else who stands with Senator McCain specifically on that question?\n\n\n\nAll right. We're going to go back to Scott.\n\n\n\nGo ahead, Scott.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Scott, go ahead.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: Wolf, if I've got -- if I have reservations in my district, can I speak up also?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You'll have an opportunity.\n\n\n\nGo ahead, Scott.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: OK. This question's for Governor Gilmore.\n\n\n\nConservative credentials is the topic, sir. You've gotten a lot of mileage out of lumping Messrs. Giuliani, McCain and Romney together by calling them Rudy McRomney.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nNow, with former Senator Fred Thompson likely to join you at the next debate, in your opinion, is he conservative enough for America or are we changing the name now to Rudy McRomneyson?\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nGILMORE: Well, we've gotten a little mileage out of Rudy McRomney. I know the mayor one time said that it would make a good ticket, and it would. But it isn't a conservative ticket. And we don't know what Fred Thompson is either.\n\n\n\nI think he's a fine man. He served in the Senate a term and a half. Let's see exactly what his views are.\n\n\n\nI'm coming forward and offering my views as a 40-year battler for conservative values and conservative principles on behalf of the people of the United States.\n\n\n\nAnd I have the record to back it up. I've been a prosecutor. I've been an attorney general. I've been a governor. I governed as a conservative. I cut taxes for the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I've stood by these principles for years and years.\n\n\n\nThe question is that when Fred Thompson comes into the race, as I believe he will -- and maybe even Speaker Gingrich may come into the race. They'll have to stand on their records and stand on their credentials and offer their ideas the same way that every person here on the stage is doing.\n\n\n\nI look forward to that day, and I look forward to the debate.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nGovernor Thompson, is there a need for another Thompson in this race?\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: I think that anybody with a Thompson name should get involved if they want to get involved. It's a great name. He's a great candidate. And I think it will help the Republican Party to have him in.\n\n\n\nI just would like to say that if you're talking about conservatism -- and that's what you're talking about -- there isn't a candidate on either side of the aisle that has had as many vetoes as I have.\n\n\n\nNobody has reduced taxes as much as I have.\n\n\n\nAnd if you're talking about a reliable conservative, it is this Thompson, Tommy Thompson, not the other, that's the conservative.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nMayor Giuliani, there was some news here today. A Catholic bishop in Rhode Island said some words about your position on abortion, suggesting that it was similar to Pontius Pilate's personal opposition to Jesus Christ's crucifixion, but allowing it to happen anyway. How does that make you feel when you hear words like that from a Catholic bishop?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Well, Catholic bishop -- any religion (inaudible).\n\n\n\nBLITZER: That's the lightning that's having an effect on our system.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I know.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nI guess I'm here by myself.\n\n\n\nLook, for someone who went to parochial schools all his life, this is a very frightening thing that's happening right now.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBut the reality is I respect, you know, the opinion of Catholic (inaudible) and religious leaders of all kinds. Religion is very important to me. It's a very important part of my life.\n\n\n\nBut ultimately, as (inaudible) been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law, I've got to make the decisions that I think are the right ones in a country like ours.\n\n\n\nAnd my view on abortion is that it's wrong, but that ultimately government should not be enforcing that decision on a woman.\n\n\n\nThat is my view that I -- I consult my religion. I consult my reading of the Constitution. I consult my views of what I think are important in a pluralistic society, and the reality that we have to respect the fact that there are people that are equally as religious, equally as moral, that make a different decision about this, and should government put them in jail?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You made, Governor Romney, this decision on abortion, opposing abortion, relatively recently.\n\n\n\nWhy should conservatives out there, people who oppose abortion, believe you?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, people can look at my record. I'm not going to apologize for the fact that I became pro-life. I served as governor. As I was governor, as we were debating cloning and as we were debating also embryo farming, I said Roe v. Wade has gone too far.\n\n\n\nI want to make it very clear that I'm pro-life. People here in New Hampshire have seen that I fought for life. I fought also for traditional marriage, to keep taxes down, to have education in our schools that includes abstinence education. I've fought for English immersion in our schools.\n\n\n\nThey know that I've got conservative credentials. And that's one of the things that brings me to this race.\n\n\n\nBut there's something bigger in conservatism that I don't think we've spoken about. And that is that America is a land of opportunity. And our future is going to be far brighter than our past, not just as we overcome these challenges, but as we take advantage of the new opportunity of the 21st century.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor.\n\n\n\nLet's go back to Tom for the next question.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nFAHEY: (inaudible) do not believe in evolution. You're an ordained minister. What do you believe? Is it the story of creation, as it is reported in the Bible or described in the Bible?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: It's interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president. I'm not planning on writing the curriculum for an 8th-grade science book. I'm asking for the opportunity to be president of the United States.\n\n\n\nBut you've raised the question, so let me answer it.\n\n\n\nIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth. To me, it's pretty simple. A person either believes that God created this process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own.\n\n\n\nAnd the basic question was an unfair question, because it simply asked us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed, in my view, whether there is a God or not.\n\n\n\nWell, let me be very clear: I believe there is a God. I believe there's a God who was active in the creation process.\n\n\n\nNow, how did he do it and when did he do it and how long did he take, I don't honestly know. And I don't think knowing that would make me a better or a worse president.\n\n\n\nBut I'll tell you what I can tell this country: If they want a president who doesn't believe in God, there's probably plenty of choices. But if I'm selected as president of this country, they'll have one who believes in those words that God did create.\n\n\n\nAnd as the words of Martin Luther, here I stand. I can do no other. And I will not take that back.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor, but I think the specific question is, do you believe literally it was done in six days and it occurred 6,000 years ago?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: No, I did answer that, Wolf. I said, I don't know.\n\n\n\nMy point is, I don't know. I wasn't there.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER) But I believe, whether God did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time, he did it. And that's what's important.\n\n\n\nBut, you know, if anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate, they are certainly welcome to do it. I don't know how far they will march that back.\n\n\n\nBut I believe that all of us in this room are the unique creations of a god who knows us and loves us, and who created us for his own purpose.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator Brownback, you recently elaborated on your position on this, and I wonder if you'd want to spend 30 seconds and tell our audience out there where you stand on the issue of evolution.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: I'd be happy to.\n\n\n\nAnd it's interesting that we're doing this here at St. Anselm's, who this -- that saint had a philosophy of faith seeking reason.\n\n\n\nAnd that's the issue that's missing here, if I could highlight that point, is that I believe that we are created in the image of God for a particular purpose. And I believe that with all my heart.\n\n\n\nAnd I'm somebody, I've had cancer in the past, I've had a season to really look at this and study it and think about the end of life. And I am fully convinced there's a god of the universe that loves us very much and was involved in the process.\n\n\n\nHow he did it, I don't know.\n\n\n\nOne of the problems we have with our society today is that we've put faith and science at odds with each other. They aren't at odds with each other. If they are, check your faith or check your science, and we should have a discussion.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: And we should engage faith and reason like St. Anselm did.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: That's something we should do.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator Brownback.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nSenator McCain, do you believe creationism should be taught alongside evolution in the nation's schools?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: No, I believe that that's up to the school districts. But I think that every American should be exposed to all theories.\n\n\n\nBut I can't say it more eloquently than Pastor Huckabee -- Governor Huckabee just did. And I admire his description because I hold that view.\n\n\n\nThe point is that the time before time, there's no doubt in my mind that the hand of God was in what we are today. And I do believe that we are unique, and I believe that God loves us. But I also believe that all of our children in school can be taught different views on different issues.\n\n\n\nBut I leave the curricula up to the school boards.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator, for that.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, there was a recent poll here in New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nTen percent said they wouldn't vote for you because you're a Mormon. And last week, we saw that picture of that man who refused to shake your hand because you are a Mormon.\n\n\n\nWhat would you like to say to the voters out there tonight about your faith, about yourself and about God?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, President Kennedy some time ago said he was not a Catholic running for president, he was an American running for president. And I'm happy to be a proud member of my faith.\n\n\n\nYou know, I think it's a fair question for people to ask, what do you believe? And I think if you want to understand what I believe, you could recognize that the values that I have are the same values you'll find in faiths across this country.\n\n\n\nI believe in God, believe in the Bible, believe Jesus Christ is my savior. I believe that God created man in his image. I believe that the freedoms of man derive from inalienable rights that were given to us by God.\n\n\n\nAnd I also believe that there are some pundits out there that are hoping that I'll distance myself from my church so that that'll help me politically. And that's not going to happen.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor, for that.\n\n\n\nCongressman Paul, you ran for president once before as a libertarian. What do you say about this whole issue of church and state and these issues that are coming forward right now?\n\n\n\nPAUL: Well, I think we should read the First Amendment, where it says, \"Congress shall write no law,\" and we should write a lot less laws regarding this matter. It shouldn't be a matter of the president or the Congress. It should be local people, local officials.\n\n\n\nThe state should determine so many of these things that we just don't need more laws determining religious things or prayer in schools. We should allow people at the local level. That's what the Constitution tells us.\n\n\n\nWe don't need somebody in Washington telling us what we can do, because we don't have perfect knowledge. And that's the magnificence of our Constitution and our republic. We sort out the difficult problems at local levels, and we don't have, you know, one-case-fit- all.\n\n\n\nBecause you have a Supreme Court ruling, like on Roe v. Wade, it ruined it for the whole country. And that's why we shouldn't have it at a central level.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nLet's go back to another question from Tom.\n\n\n\nFAHEY: This is for Mayor Giuliani.\n\n\n\nSea levels around the world are rising. Average temperatures are increasing. A U.N. report written by scientists from 113 countries recently said that climate change is very likely man-made and may affect us for centuries to come.\n\n\n\nIs science wrong on global warming? And what, if any, steps would you take as president to address the issue of climate change?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I think we have to accept the view that scientists have, that there is global warming, and that human operation, human condition contributes to that.\n\n\n\nAnd the fact is that there is a way to deal with it and to address it in a way that we can also accomplish energy independence, which we need as a matter of national security.\n\n\n\nIt's frustrating and really dangerous for us to see money going to our enemies because we have to buy oil from certain countries. We should be supporting all the alternatives.\n\n\n\nWe need a project similar to putting a man on the moon. That project started with Eisenhower. It was carried out by Kennedy and then Johnson and then Nixon. And that was two Democrats and two Republicans working (inaudible) Democrats working in the national interest.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\nI want Governor Romney to weigh in as well.\n\n\n\nThere's a perception, at least among some, that Republicans are -- at least the Republican Party -- very close to big oil. A lot of Americans are suffering now from the price of gasoline -- high price of gasoline. What do you say to the audience out there who believes that there's too much of an alliance, if you will, between the big oil companies and Republicans?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, first of all, Rudy Giuliani is right, in terms of an Apollo project to get us to energy independent. And the effects of that on global warming are positive. It's a no-regrets policy. It's a great idea.\n\n\n\nSecondly, with regards to big oil, big oil is making a lot of money right now. And I'd like to see them using that money to invest in refineries.\n\n\n\nDon't forget that when companies earn profit, that money's supposed to be reinvested in growth. And our refineries are old.\n\n\n\nSomeone said to me -- Matt Simmons, an investment banker down in Houston -- he said, \"Our refineries today are rust, with paint holding them up.\"\n\n\n\nAnd we need to see these companies, if they're making that kind of money, reinvest in capital equipment.\n\n\n\nBut let's not forget that where the money is being made this year is not just -- and throughout these years -- is not just in Exxon and Shell and the major oil companies. It's in the countries that own this oil.\n\n\n\nRussia last year took in $500 billion by selling oil. Ahmadinejad, Putin, Chavez -- these people are getting rich off of people buying too much oil.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why we have to pursue, as a strategic imperative, energy independence for America.\n\n\n\nAnd it takes that Apollo project. It also takes biodiesel, biofuel, ethanol...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: ... cellulosic ethanol, nuclear power, more drilling in ANWR.\n\n\n\nWe have to be serious also about efficiency.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: And that's going to allow us to become energy- independent.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator McCain, do you have a problem at this time with these oil companies making these huge profits?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: Sure. I think we all do. And they ought to be reinvesting it. And one of the areas that they ought to be involved in is nuclear power. Nuclear power is safe. Nuclear power is green, does not emit greenhouse gases. Nuclear power is used on Navy ships which have sailed around the world for 60 years without an accident.\n\n\n\nAnd of course we ought to be investing in alternate energy sources.\n\n\n\nRecently there was a group of retired military officers who said that climate change and energy independence is a national security issue. It is. We've got to reduce our dependence on imported oil.\n\n\n\nWe can do it through a wide variety of alternative fuels. But we have to be serious about it and we're going to have to go to places where we have never gone before. And nuclear power is one of the major issues, but also all kinds of ethanol as well.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nLet me bring Congressman Paul back into this conversation.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, President Bush signed an energy bill that provided billions of dollars in tax break subsidies to the oil companies, with the goal of boosting domestic production. At a time of these record profits, do you believe these companies need a helping hand from the federal government?\n\n\n\nPAUL: I don't think the profits is the issue. The profits are OK if they're legitimately earned in a free market. What I object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them R&D money. I don't think that should be that way. They should take it out of the funds that they earn.\n\n\n\nBut also, you can't discuss energy without discussing our foreign policy.\n\n\n\nWhy do we go to the Middle East? We know the oil is very important about the Middle East and why we're there. Why did we, our government, help overthrow Mosaddeq in 1953? It had to do with oil.\n\n\n\nSo, our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests.\n\n\n\nThe profits, that's not the problem. It's the problem that we succumb to the temptation to protect oil interests by literally going out and fighting wars over oil.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor Gilmore, you agree?\n\n\n\nGILMORE: I agree that if you make profits of the open marketplace, that that's an appropriate thing to do. I also believe that they should be going in and putting this additional money into additional drilling, into additional exploration.\n\n\n\nBut it's going to have to be bigger than that. We're going to have to in fact look to all sources: ethanol, biomass, coal, clean coal, the opportunities for natural gas, and nuclear power. And by the way, nuclear power will help this whole issue of global warming.\n\n\n\nAnd one more point in direct answer to your question: The Kyoto treaty was, in fact, fatally flawed. That was a treaty that in fact was going to basically just transfer our money directly to Russia for nothing, because they were going to get credits because simply that their economy had declined.\n\n\n\nThe truth is, we're going to have to get a program in place, an international diplomatic answer, that is going to include every nation of the world in this entire project. And that includes China and India.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nLet me bring Scott back for the next question.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: Congressman Paul, a question for you.\n\n\n\nMost of our closest allies, including Great Britain and Israel, allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military. Is it time to end don't ask/don't tell policy and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the U.S. military?\n\n\n\nPAUL: I think the current policy is a decent policy.\n\n\n\nAnd the problem that we have with dealing with this subject is we see people as groups, as they belong to certain groups and that they derive their rights as belonging to groups.\n\n\n\nWe don't get our rights because we're gays or women or minorities. We get our rights from our creator as individuals. So every individual should be treated the same way.\n\n\n\nSo if there is homosexual behavior in the military that is disruptive, it should be dealt with.\n\n\n\nBut if there's heterosexual sexual behavior that is disruptive, it should be dealt with.\n\n\n\nSo it isn't the issue of homosexuality. It's the concept and the understanding of individual rights. If we understood that, we would not be dealing with this very important problem.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor Huckabee, I want you to weigh in as well.\n\n\n\nDo you believe it's time to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the United States military?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Wolf, I think it's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct. I think that's what Congressman Paul was saying: It's about conduct; it's not about attitude.\n\n\n\nBut I'd like to ask you. You said a moment ago that you were going to all give us a chance to deal with the issue of immigration.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to come back to that.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: And I hope you'll do that.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We will. We'll come back to immigration.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: You held us to it, and now I want to hold you to it, so...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to come back...\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: ... if you could give us that opportunity.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to come back to immigration.\n\n\n\nBut right now, we're talking about allowing gays to serve openly in the military. But you're opposed to that?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: I just said I think it's a matter -- it's not -- you don't punish people for their attitudes; you punish them if their behavior creates a problem. And it's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: So you wouldn't change existing policy.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: What?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You wouldn't change existing policy.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: I don't think that I would. I think it's already covered by the existing policy that we do have, in fact.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, recently we've learned that several talented trained linguists -- Arabic speakers, Farsi speakers, Urdu speakers -- trained by the U.S. government to learn those languages to help us in the war on terrorism, were dismissed from the military because they announced they were gays or lesbians.\n\n\n\nIs that, in your mind, appropriate?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: This is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this.\n\n\n\nBack in 1994 we went through this. And it created a tremendous amount of disruption. Colin Powell, I think, was still the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before he left at the beginning of the Clinton administration.\n\n\n\nHe came to the view that this was a good policy.\n\n\n\nAnd I think in time of war, in a time where we're trying to deal with this transition to a new kind of warfare that we have to be fighting -- and we haven't gotten all the way there yet. We need a hybrid army, we need to look at nation-building as part of what we have to teach our military. I don't think this would be the right time to raise these issues.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: And I think we should rely on the judgment of our commanders in a situation like this. They know what's disruptive and what's not. And at a time of war, you don't make fundamental changes like this.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, the mayor referred to the don't ask/don't tell policy, which was implemented during the Clinton administration, after Bill Clinton became president.\n\n\n\nIn 1994, you were quoted as saying that you advocated gays being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation's military.\n\n\n\nThe question to you is, do you still feel that way?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: No, actually when I first heard of the don't ask/don't tell policy I thought it sounded awfully silly and didn't think that'd be very effective, and I turned out to be wrong.\n\n\n\nIt's been the policy now in the military for, what, 10, 15 years? And it seems to be working.\n\n\n\nAnd I agree with what Mayor Giuliani said, that this is not the time to put in place a major change, a social experiment, in the middle of a war going on.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't change it at this point. We can look at it down the road. But it does seem to me that we have much bigger issues as a nation that we ought to be talking about than that policy right now.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator McCain, you've been involved in military matters virtually your whole life. What do you say?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: We have the best-trained, most professional, best- equipped, most efficient, most wonderful military in the history of this country. And I'm proud of every one of them.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThere just aren't enough of them. So I have to rely on our military leadership, in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young Americans in combat as we speak.\n\n\n\nSo I think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue. It is working, my friends. The policy is working.\n\n\n\nAnd I am convinced that that's the way we can maintain this greatest military. As much as I revere the greatest generation, as much as I love my own generation, this is the very best. Let's not tamper with them.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Is there anyone here who believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the United States military?\n\n\n\nIf you do, speak up now.\n\n\n\nScott, go ahead with your question.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: Gentlemen, last night, we asked Democrats, if they were elected, what role would they use former President Clinton? I'm not going to ask you that.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBut, Governor Thompson, I'd like to know, seeing as how you were a member of President Bush's Cabinet as health and human services secretary, how would you use George W. Bush in your administration?\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: I certainly would not send him to the United Nations.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nI believe George W. Bush has tremendous characteristics. He's very honest. He's very straightforward.\n\n\n\nI would put him out on a lecture series, talking to the youth of America about honesty, integrity, perseverance, passion, and serving the public.\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush believes very much in public service, as does his father, as does his brothers, as does his mother.\n\n\n\nI think he could be a wonderful spokesperson, making sure that young people realize that public service is a very noble cause and something that young people should aspire to, like all the young people here on this campus should also have the opportunity to serve in public life.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator Brownback, same question to you: If you're elected president, what would you ask your predecessor to do?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: Well, I would talk with him about it first, and I would ask him about it. I think he would probably take a position the way his dad did, saying, \"You know, I think you need to have your time in the limelight. And I will be willing to help out if you have a tragedy overseas.\"\n\n\n\nHis father has been excellent, in the tsunami that hit Sri Lanka and other places, in helping fund-raising.\n\n\n\nHe's been a wonderful ambassador in those sorts of situations.\n\n\n\nAnd frankly, I think that's the right role for an ex-president. And I really think, in many respects, President Clinton has not assumed the right role of an ex-president, where he's injected himself a lot more on policy issues that haven't been appropriate, and he really should defer more to the person that's in the job.\n\n\n\nThere's one person that's president at a time, and that's the way it should be.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Congressman Tancredo, I see you anxious to weigh in.\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: Thank you.\n\n\n\nSome time ago, in 2003 I think it was, that I got a call from Karl Rove, who told me that, because of my criticism of the president, I should never darken the doorstep of the White House.\n\n\n\nI have been so disappointed in the president in so many ways since his -- actually for the last several years, not just the immigration issue, but several other things, including the No Child Left Behind and the massive increase in government that we call prescription drug -- Medicare prescription drug, that I'm afraid I would have to tell the president of the United States -- I mean, as president, I would have to tell George Bush exactly the same thing Karl Rove told me.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nGovernor Huckabee...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n... you served, as you reminded us, a long time as a governor, Republican governor of Arkansas. Your old job is now in Democratic hands. Here in New Hampshire, the GOP has suffered some significant losses as well. And the Republicans lost the majority in the House and the Senate, as you well know.\n\n\n\nSimple question: What's happened to the GOP?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Lost credibility, because we didn't do what we were hired to do.\n\n\n\nWhen you're elected, you're hired to do a job. You're hired to cut spending, lower taxes, bring more government back to the local people. We did the polar opposite. And the people fired us.\n\n\n\nAnd I think, in many ways, though there were some good people that got caught up in the tsunami of the 2006 elections, the Republican Party, as a whole, deserved to get beat.\n\n\n\nWe've lost credibility, the way we bungled Katrina, the fact that there was corruption that was unchecked in Washington, and the fact that there was a feeling that there was not a proper handling of the Iraqi war in all of its details, and the indifference to people pouring over our borders.\n\n\n\nAnd let me just add this, Wolf. There are a lot of people for whom the immigration issue is like a lot of them. They see Washington not taking the kind of positions to build a fence, and they know that when they go to the airport to get on an airplane, they have to show photo I.D., they have to go through layers of security, and they don't understand why someone across an international border doesn't have to do the same thing.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCongressman Hunter, I want to just -- because he raised the issue -- he raised the issue of corruption.\n\n\n\nDo you think it would be appropriate for President Bush to pardon Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, who was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for his role in the CIA leak case?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: You know, I think, Wolf, to make a determination on that, you'd have to look at the transcript.\n\n\n\nI'll tell you a couple of transcripts I have looked at, and that's the agents, Compean and Ramos, who were given 11 and 12 years respectively for stopping a drug dealer bringing 750 pounds of drugs across the border.\n\n\n\nI've looked at their transcript; I would pardon Compean and Ramos right now.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nAnd let me say, with respect to what Mike said, we've got to bring back the Reagan Democrats to this party, because we need the Reagan Democrats for Republican leadership to work.\n\n\n\nAnd we're going to have to get a good trade bill that brings jobs back to this country. We're going to have to stop China from cheating on trade, build the middle class, build jobs, Wolf. That's what strengthens the Republican Party.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I just want to do a quick \"yes\" or \"no.\" And I'm going to go down the rest of the group and let everybody just tell me \"yes\" or \"no\": Would you pardon Scooter Libby?\n\n\n\n(UNKNOWN): No.\n\n\n\nGILMORE: No. I'm steeped in the law. I wouldn't do that.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: No, not without reading the transcript.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Not without reading the transcript.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: He's going through an appeal process. We've got to see what happens here.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I think the sentence was way out of line. I mean, the sentence was grossly excessive in a situation in which, at the beginning, the prosecutor knew who the leak was...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: So, yes or no, would you pardon him?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: ... and he knew a crime wasn't committed. I recommended over a thousand pardons to President Reagan when I was associate attorney general. I would see if it fit the criteria for pardon. I'd wait for the appeal.\n\n\n\nI think what the judge did today argues more in favor of a pardon because...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: ... this is excessive punishment.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: When you consider -- I've prosecuted 5,000 cases.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I'm trying to get a yes or no.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Well, this is a very important issue. This is a very, very important -- a man's life is at stake. And the reality is, this is an incomprehensible situation.\n\n\n\nThey knew who the leak was.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Hey, Wolf, can I explain...\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: And ultimately, there was no underlying crime involved.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: This is one of those situations where I go back to my record as governor. I didn't pardon anybody as governor, because I didn't want to overturn a jury.\n\n\n\nBut in this case, you have a prosecutor who clearly abused prosecutorial discretion by going after somebody when he already knew that the source of the leak was Richard Armitage.\n\n\n\nHe'd been told that. So he went on a political vendetta.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Was that a yes?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: It's worth looking at that. I will study it very closely if I'm lucky enough to be president. And I'd keep that option open.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: Yes. The basic crime here didn't happen. What they were saying was that the identity of an agent... BLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nGovernor?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: ... was revealed, but that agent has to be in the field for that to be a crime. That didn't occur.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor?\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: Bill Clinton committed perjury at a grand jury, lost his law license. Scooter Libby got 30 months. To me, it's not fair at all.\n\n\n\nBut I would make sure the appeal was done properly, and then I would examine the record.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Congressman?\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: Yes.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Yes.\n\n\n\nAll right. We heard from all of them.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nWe're ready to take -- go into part two of tonight's debate right now, where voters from New Hampshire will have an opportunity to ask their questions. We have some work to do here on the stage.\n\n\n\nWhile we move some chairs around, move out the podiums, while we do all that, and you'll be able to see it, viewers of WMUR are going to go back to their studios. For the rest of you, I'm going to bring in my colleagues, Larry King and Anderson Cooper, part of the best political team on television, to give us a sense of this debate so far.\n\n\n\nOur debate here will resume in about three minutes.\n\n\n\n(BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're now set for our voters here to ask questions. Our pool of voters here are either registered Republicans or independents, but they're likely -- likely to vote Republican in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.\n\n\n\nWe brought them together with the help from the New Hampshire Political Library and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. CNN producers have interviewed all of them. Working with me in this half of the debate is Jennifer Vaughn from our partner WMUR-TV.\n\n\n\nJennifer, who has the first question?\n\n\n\nJENNIFER VAUGHN, WMUR-TV: Thank you, Wolf.\n\n\n\nAnd good evening to you all tonight. I have Erin Flanagan with me tonight.\n\n\n\nHi, Erin.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Hi, Jennifer.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You live in Bedford, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I do.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You have a question about the war in Iraq, which is something that is deeply personal to you.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: It is. Unfortunately, my beloved little brother, 1st Lieutenant Michael Joseph Cleary, was killed in action in Taji, Iraq, eight days before he was to return home on December 20th of 2005.\n\n\n\nHe was the best of the best and answered the call to serve our country.\n\n\n\nMy family has been devastated by the loss.\n\n\n\nAs a member of an American family who has suffered so greatly at the choices made by the current administration, I desperately would like to know what you as commander in chief would do, both in the halls of the American government, to bring the parties together, as well as on the desert sands of the Middle East to bring this conflict to a point in which we can safely bring our troops home.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Erin, thank you.\n\n\n\nCongressman Hunter, let's begin with you on that.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: OK. Absolutely.\n\n\n\nThe key to leaving -- and, incidentally, thank you for his service.\n\n\n\nAnd I want to let you know, my son...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nI want to let you know that my son Duncan, the day after 9/11, joined the Marine Corps, quit his job, did two tours in Iraq. He's in Afghanistan right now.\n\n\n\nFirst, I want you to know that it's worth it.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nWhat he did was worth it.\n\n\n\nAnd if we can achieve a country in Iraq that will not be an state sponsor of terrorism for the next 5 to 10 to 20 years, that will be a friend, not an enemy, of the United States, and will have a modicum of freedom, that is in the national interest of the United States, just like establishing a free Japan on the other side of the Pacific was in our interest after World War II, just like providing freedom and a protective shield for Salvador in Central America was in our interest.\n\n\n\nSo what I would do, and what we need to do right now, and we are doing, is standing up the Iraqi army. There is 129 battalions of Iraqis that we've trained and equipped.\n\n\n\nWe need to start moving them into the combat zones where they displace the heavy American combat forces. Then we can pull our forces out. We can bring them home or send them wherever Uncle Sam needs them again.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: That's how we leave Iraq the right way.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nSenator Brownback, I'd like you to weigh in.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: If I could.\n\n\n\nAnd thank you for your family's service and what your brother did. That's incredible and an incredible gift that he and your family have given us.\n\n\n\nAnd I think you've identified the right thing. It's not about leaving, and it's not about being defeated. It's about getting the situation to a point that we can turn it over to Iraqis, and then us pull back from the front of the line.\n\n\n\nThat's why I'm putting forward tomorrow a bill, and this would be about a three-state solution in Iraq -- a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shia state -- with Baghdad as the federal city, in a loose, weak, federated system; oil revenues equally divided.\n\n\n\nAnd it's a bipartisan bill. We will have bipartisan support.\n\n\n\nWe've got to pull together here to win over there.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: And we can do this together, but we haven't put yet forward, this administration, a political solution that will be long- term and durable.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: That's what we've got to do.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator McCain, is that a good idea, to divide up Iraq into three separate...\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: It's not divided. It's three states, one country.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: It's not -- ma'am, I want to tell you thank you for your brother's service and sacrifice to our country. We are proud of you and your endurance, and we're proud of your sacrifice.\n\n\n\nThis war -- I'm going to give you a little straight talk. This war was very badly mismanaged for a long time. And Americans have made great sacrifices, some of which were unnecessary because of this management of the war -- mismanagement of this conflict.\n\n\n\nI believe we have a fine general. I believe we have a strategy which can succeed, so that the sacrifice of your brother would not be in vain, that a whole 20 million or 30 million people would have a chance to live a free life in an open society, and practice their religion, no matter what those differences are.\n\n\n\nAnd I believe that if we fail, it will become a center of terrorism, and we will ask more young Americans to sacrifice, as your brother did.\n\n\n\nThis is long and hard and tough. But I think we can succeed.\n\n\n\nAnd God bless you.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nJennifer, go ahead with your next question.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Cynthia Kiernan is here with us tonight.\n\n\n\nCynthia, you live in Merrimack, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You can go ahead and stand up.\n\n\n\nAnd you brought your husband with you?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes. Michael served in Iraq.\n\n\n\nAnd we have a question regarding the government in Iraq. Everyone's talking about, \"Pull our troops out; pull our troops out.\" Well, considering they've lived under a dictatorship for the last 30 years or so, what are we going to do to make sure they have a government in place before we do pull our troops out and they're able to help themselves? Otherwise, we're just putting them in a position to accept another terrorist leader.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Congressman Paul?\n\n\n\nPAUL: Well, we've had four years to do this and it hasn't worked.\n\n\n\nThe biggest incentive for them to take upon themselves the responsibility is just for us to leave.\n\n\n\nPAUL: We don't need to lose 100 men and women every month, more than a thousand per year.\n\n\n\nAnd so, if you want it done, you want them to take over, you've got to give them an incentive.\n\n\n\nSo I think we should immediately stop patrolling the streets. That's a policeman's job. It's not the work of the Army. We're not fighting a military battle. We're in a different type of warfare right now.\n\n\n\nSo the sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can make sure that no more Americans will die.\n\n\n\nWe have a lot of goodness in this country. And we should promote it, but never through the barrel of a gun. We should do it by setting good standards, motivating people and have them want to emulate us.\n\n\n\nBut you can't enforce our goodness, like the necons preach, with an armed force. It doesn't work.\n\n\n\nWoodrow Wilson was telling us about that, in promoting democracy a long time ago.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nPAUL: It doesn't work and we have to admit it.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nLet me bring Mayor Giuliani in.\n\n\n\nI don't know if you consider yourself a neocon, but go ahead and respond to what Congressman Paul said.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Michael, thank you very much for serving us, and thank your family for their tremendous sacrifice.\n\n\n\nI'd like to put it in a slightly different context. I believe that your service for us and your brother's sacrifice is one of the reasons we're safe now in the United States.\n\n\n\nI believe that this terrorist war began way back in the 1970s. They attacked us in 1993 in New York. They attacked us again in 2001 in a horrible way.\n\n\n\nAnd I believe that what we're doing in Iraq, if we can get it right, is going to help reduce the risk for this country. And if we get it wrong, this is going to be much, much worse for us.\n\n\n\nAnd part of what we have to do and we haven't done right is take on that responsibility of nation-building. We created that responsibility for ourselves when we overthrew Saddam Hussein, which we did very effectively. It was one of the greatest military actions in American history, overthrowing Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n\nBut we didn't accomplish the second step. People can only embrace democracy when they have an orderly existence. And we have to help provide that. We didn't want that role, but it is our role.\n\n\n\nAnd we have to train our military to do it.\n\n\n\nWe should probably have an IraqStat program, in which we measure how many people are going to school, how many factories are open, how many people are going back to work.\n\n\n\nWe had to get into the nitty-gritty of putting an orderly society together in Iraq. It is not too late to do it.\n\n\n\nAnd I'd just like to ask, I'd just like to ask one question I didn't get to ask before, when you said, if General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things aren't going well, what are we going to do?\n\n\n\nBut suppose General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things are going pretty well. Are we going to report that with the same amount of attention that we would report the negative news?\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Jennifer, go ahead.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Kysa Crusco is here with us tonight.\n\n\n\nHi, Kysa.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Hi.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire. You are an attorney.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I am.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: OK. What's your question tonight?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: My question is whether you believe that a conservative platform can also include a conservationist agenda. And, if so, how?\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Governor Gilmore?\n\n\n\nGILMORE: The question was whether or not a conservative agenda can also have a conservation agenda. And I think that it can.\n\n\n\nCertainly, when I was governor of the state of Virginia, we worked very hard in order to make Virginia a beautiful place and a place where we could in fact be welcoming to people, and that it would be a nice community for people to visit.\n\n\n\nBut at the end of the day, this is going to come down to the question of whether or not conservatism can match up with energy independence, which is a national security issue and it is a fundamental part of conservatism.\n\n\n\nConservatism means empowering people. It means cutting taxes and controlling government spending. It also means national security. And national security means a lot of different elements right at this time. And we're discussing some of them tonight.\n\n\n\nAnd I can assure the people who are families here tonight, their young people, young men and women who are on the battle lines, and people who are committing their lives, they are in fact serving the national interests of this country in a time of major crisis.\n\n\n\nThe other two issues, however, would also go to the issue of the immigration issue, which I want to come back to at some point, but also energy independence.\n\n\n\nAnd energy independence also can serve the interests of conservation...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nGILMORE: ... particularly if we use nuclear power and other clean forms of energy so that we can in fact make this a clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor.\n\n\n\nCongressman Tancredo, do you believe true conservatives should be doing more to protect the environment?\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: Yes.\n\n\n\nI think that that's absolutely imperative, and I think so because, frankly, you've got a conservative model to pick from. I mean, you know, Teddy Roosevelt, after all, put this stamp on that -- the whole issue of conserving the environment, creating the national parks system.\n\n\n\nThere's nothing anti-conservative about doing anything like that.\n\n\n\nAnd you know what else you can do in order to foster that? You do it through conservative principles. You make it profitable for people to do exactly that, to put -- to make conservation an issue that hits people in the pocketbook, or they can profit by getting involved in conservation.\n\n\n\nThat's one way the free market really works perfectly. We've seen it happen all over the world. We can see and we will put conservation to work -- conservation practices to work in the United States through conservative principles. We have a lock on that.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nJennifer, go ahead.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Good evening, sir. You are Doug Hall.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: I understand that you're the town moderator for Chichester, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I am.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: What's your question tonight?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I know a business owner in northern New Hampshire who was on vacation in Spain last year for about three weeks. While he was there, he had to buy refills for prescription drugs, brand name drugs, and he discovered in buying those drugs that he could buy his refills there for $600 less than he could buy them here in New Hampshire. So since then, he said he is going to take a trip over to Spain and get his vacation paid for to buy his drugs.\n\n\n\nMy question to you is, why is this? And if you are elected president, is there anything you would do to address it?\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Mayor Giuliani?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: What I would do is change the whole model that we have for health insurance in this country.\n\n\n\nThe problem with our health insurance is, it's government and employer-dominated. People don't make individual choices. It's your health. You should own your health insurance.\n\n\n\nWe should be giving you a major tax deduction, $15,000 for a family, so you can buy your own health insurance. If you buy health insurance for $8,000 or $9,000, you'll save $5,000 or $6,000 in tax- free money.\n\n\n\nThen we should have a health savings account, in which you can put some money aside to pay for your ordinary medical expenses.\n\n\n\nHealth insurance should become like homeowners insurance or like car insurance. You don't cover everything on your homeowners policy. If you have a slight accident in your house, if you need to refill your oil with your car, you don't cover that with insurance. But that is covered in many of the insurance policies, because they're government-dominated and they're employer-dominated.\n\n\n\nWhat the Democrats suggested on this stage two nights ago was socialized medicine. There was a man in California who said to me, \"When we make health insurance free, just wait and see how expensive it will become.\"\n\n\n\nAnd the reality is that we need a free market. We need 100 million Americans making different decisions. It will bring down the cost of health insurance. It will bring down the cost of prescription medicines.\n\n\n\nFree-market principles are the only things that reduce costs and improve quality. Socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the United States. BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCongressman Hunter, you live on the border, San Diego, not far from Mexico. A lot of Americans go to Mexico to buy cheaper prescription drugs. A lot of Americans in this part of the country go to Canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs.\n\n\n\nWhat should we here in the United States be doing to bring down the price of prescription drugs?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: And, Wolf, the fabulous Grampy, my father-in-law, who lives with us, is one of those people that trots down and goes through the border at Yuma and does that. So lots of Americans do that.\n\n\n\nBut here's what happens. Eighty percent of the new drugs and new inventions that save our lives, that help preserve the lives of the relatives of everyone who's in this particular room right now, 80 percent of those inventions are made in the United States because we have free enterprise, where people can go out, invest. And maybe they drill three dry holes in trying to produce a good drug that will save somebody's lives. Then maybe they hit the jackpot and they produce something that will save people and help their health.\n\n\n\nThey then recover their money in the United States. And what they have left over, in terms of market, they put into the Third World. But Third World countries like Mexico could never provide the amount of money that it takes to make those inventions. Otherwise, they would.\n\n\n\nHere's what we have to do: We need to be able to buy our health care insurance across state lines, Wolf. Right now the same single policy that can be purchased in Long Beach for $73 costs $334 in New Jersey.\n\n\n\nThe states lock up the insurance industry. They won't let Americans buy across state lines, just like they do everything else. If we're able to do that...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: ... we're going to bring down the cost of health insurance.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nJennifer, let's go back to another question.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Also on the topic of health care tonight, this is a question from our wmur.gather.com blogger, who is Joshua Williamson.\n\n\n\nJoshua asks, \"Millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the current state of our health-care system, and U.S. employers are at a disadvantage due to the high cost of health insurance. What would you do to fix the health-care system? And would you support implementing a single-payer system, in which the government acts as the insurer in order to save enough money to cover the millions of uninsured and to lower premiums for the rest of the U.S. population?\"\n\n\n\nGovernor Thompson, let's have you weigh in on that.\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: You know, I've been here for two debates. We never had one question on health care. Thank that person for talking about health care.\n\n\n\nNumber one, we spend $2 trillion on health care. That's 16 percent of the gross national product. Ninety-three percent of the cost of health care goes into waiting until after you become sick. Only 7 percent of the money is used to keep you well in the first place.\n\n\n\nWe got to completely transform the health care system, make it a wellness system and make it a prevention system.\n\n\n\nSecondly, we have 125 million Americans that have one or more chronic illnesses. In order to change this, we have to educate the American people about tobacco, about diabetes, about cardiovascular and about obesity.\n\n\n\nYou do that, you'll be able to change health care.\n\n\n\nThe third thing, 25 percent of Americans use two-thirds of the cost of health care. If you manage those diseases, you can reduce that down to 50 percent and save lots of money.\n\n\n\nFourth, information technology, electronic medical record, a patient bill of rights and be able to have e-prescribing. And if you do that, you're going to be able to save billions of dollars.\n\n\n\nIf you just go paperless, ladies and gentlemen, you will save 10 percent of the cost of health care.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor, very much.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, you worked with the Democrats in the state legislature in your home state, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. You worked with Ted Kennedy to come up with a program that provides some -- mandates, in effect, the individual health insurance coverage.\n\n\n\nSome conservatives say this is simply big government, more liberal involvement in people's lives.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to those conservatives who are critical of the way you handled this issue in Massachusetts?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, I want to talk to the people, not just to those conservatives who are critical. And the people of this country recognize they've got some real concerns in health care. And I learned after I was governor a short bit of time -- I talked to people and they say, \"If I lose my job, I'm going to lose my insurance. And my insurance premiums are getting higher and higher and higher.\"\n\n\n\nAnd I talked to small-business people, and they said, \"I can't afford the policies anymore.\"\n\n\n\nAnd we said, \"You know, we've got to find a way to get everybody insured. And the last thing we want is to have the government take over health care, because anything they take over gets worse, not better.\n\n\n\n\"We're going to turn to Washington, because Washington makes a mess. Washington is all talk.\n\n\n\nAnd we said, \"We need to find a way to get everybody in our state insured with private insurance.\"\n\n\n\nThe half a million who didn't have insurance, all the people worried that if they lost their job, they'd lose insurance, we said, \"We've got to find a way to get them insured without raising taxes, without a government takeover.\"\n\n\n\nAnd that's what we did. It relies on personal responsibility.\n\n\n\nThis is a big issue for this country. Every Democrat up there is talking about a form of socialized medicine, government takeover, massive tax increase.\n\n\n\nWe have to stand up and not just talk about it. I'm the guy who actually tackled this issue. We get all of our citizens insured. We get people that were uninsured with private health insurance.\n\n\n\nWe have to stand up and say, \"The market works. Personal responsibility works.\"\n\n\n\nWe're going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford, that's theirs, that's portable. They never have to worry about losing it. That's the answer.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nJennifer, go ahead.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Thank you, Wolf.\n\n\n\nNext question comes from you, sir. Your name is Max Latona.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes, it is.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire. What do you do for a living, sir?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I teach philosophy here at Saint Anselm College.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: And what's your question tonight?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: My question is a simple one: In your opinion, what is the most pressing moral issue facing this country today? And, if you're elected president, how would you address that issue?\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Governor Huckabee, you are an ordained minister. What is the most pressing moral issue in this country?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Well, it looks like I'm getting all the moral questions tonight, and I guess that's a good thing.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nThat's better than getting the immoral questions. So I'm happy to get those.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: I really believe that, if you define it a moral issue, it is our respect, our sanctity and our understanding of the value of every single human life.\n\n\n\nBecause that is what makes America a unique place on this planet: We value every life of an individual as if it represents the life of us all.\n\n\n\nMany of us who are pro-life, quite frankly, I think, have made the mistake of giving people the impression that pro-life means we care intensely about people as long as that child is in the womb. But beyond the gestation period, we've not demonstrated as demonstrably as we should that we respect life at all levels, not just during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nWe shouldn't allow a child to live under a bridge or in the backseat of a car. We shouldn't be satisfied that elderly people are being abused and neglected in nursing homes. It should never be acceptable to us that people are treated as expendable -- any people.\n\n\n\nBut the unique part of our country is that we elevate and we celebrate human life. And if you look at us with a contrast to the Islamic jihadists, who would strap a bomb to the belly of their own child, march him into a crowded room, set the detonator and kill innocent people, they celebrate death; we celebrate life.\n\n\n\nIt's the fundamental thing that makes us unique, and it keeps us free. I pray we never, ever abandon that basic principle.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, what is the most pressing moral issue in America today?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I think the governor is correct. I would put it in maybe a slightly different way. We have great gifts in this country that come to us from God. We have a country in which we have freedom of religion, freedom of press, freedom for the individual, the right to elect our own officials. And the reality is that in some of the world, much of the world, that doesn't exist.\n\n\n\nAnd I think the challenge for our generation is going to be, are we able to share those gifts in an appropriate way with the rest of the world?\n\n\n\nIf we can bring along the Middle East, if we can bring along those countries that are presently our enemies, and get them to see the values of these ideals, if we have the moral strength to be able to explain it to them in the way Ronald Reagan was able to do with communism, then we can end up having the peace that we want.\n\n\n\nAnd we should not -- we should never become pessimistic about this. Remember, this is the country that was at war with Vietnam just a short while ago. We're friends now.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: This was a country that was at war with Japan, Italy and Germany a generation ago. They're some of our best friends today.\n\n\n\nWe have great resources in this country. And watching the strength of America when we believe in the essential ideals that we have -- they're not just American ideals; they come from God. And I think it's our moral obligation to find the right way to share that with the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCongressman Paul, what is the most pressing moral issue in the United States right now?\n\n\n\nPAUL: I think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote preemptive war. I do not believe that's part of the American tradition.\n\n\n\nWe, in the past, have always declared war in defense of our liberties or go to aid somebody. But now we have accepted the principle of preemptive war. We have rejected the just war theory of Christianity.\n\n\n\nAnd now, tonight, we hear that we're not even willing to remove from the table a preemptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security.\n\n\n\nI mean, we have to come to our senses about this issue of war and preemption and go back to traditions and our Constitution and defend our liberties and defend our rights, but not to think that we can change the world by force of arms and to start wars.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nSenator Brownback really wants to weigh in, as well.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: Thank you.\n\n\n\nAnd thank you for the question from a philosopher.\n\n\n\nI think it's the life issue clearly, and I'm pro-life and I'm whole life.\n\n\n\nAnd one of the things I'm the most -- the proudest about our party about is that we've stood for life. We've been a party that has stood for a culture of life. And it was in our platform in 1980, and it continues today.\n\n\n\nAnd with that respect -- and I have respect for my other colleagues -- that's why I don't think we can nominate somebody that's not pro-life in this party, because it is at our core.\n\n\n\nWe believe that every life is beautiful, is sacred, is a child of a loving God from natural -- from conception to natural death.\n\n\n\nAnd that applies not only here and in the womb, it applies to somebody that's in poverty, it applies to the child in Darfur.\n\n\n\nAnd that philosophy, being pro-life and whole life, is something I think can really help move us forward as a country and as a party.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator, if Rudy Giuliani got the Republican presidential nomination, would you be able to support him?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: That question came up at the first debate, and I stated that this is something that we as a party have struggled with. I have great respect for the mayor. I don't think we're going to nominate somebody that's not pro-life.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Would you be able to support him?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: I can support and will support the nominee of our party. But our party has stood on principles. It's a party of principles. It's not a party of personalities. We lose when we walk away from our principles.\n\n\n\nThat's when we have trouble. And that's the country wants us to do...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: ... is to stand for principles.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Jennifer, go ahead.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Next question tonight from Neil Capano.\n\n\n\nNeil, you are an airline agent.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes, I am.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nYou have a question tonight for Governor Romney.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes, I do.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank all of you for joining us tonight in beautiful Manchester, New Hampshire. However, my question is for Governor Romney exclusively.\n\n\n\nYou've been accused of -- you've been accused of flip-flopping on immigration.\n\n\n\nJust earlier tonight you indicated "

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nWOLF BLITZER, HOST: Let's begin our questioning.\n\nRight now Tom Fahey of the New Hampshire Union Leader with the first question.\n\n\n\nTOM FAHEY, NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER: Thanks, Wolf.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, I wanted to start by asking you a question on which every American has formed an opinion.\n\n\n\nWe have lost 3,400 troops, civilian casualties are even higher, and the Iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country. Knowing everything you know right now, was it a mistake for us to invade Iraq?\n\n\n\nMITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS: Well, the question is, kind of, a non sequitur, if you will. What I mean by that -- or a null set -- that is that if you're saying let's turn back the clock and Saddam Hussein had opening up his country to IAEA inspectors and they'd come in and they'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction, had Saddam Hussein therefore not violated United Nations resolutions, we wouldn't be in the conflict we're in.\n\n\n\nBut he didn't do those things, and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in.\n\n\n\nI supported the president's decision based on what we knew at that time.\n\n\n\nI think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n\nBy the way, Harry Reid was wrong. We did not lose the war in Iraq. And that's not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm's way.\n\n\n\nWe did, however, not do a great job after we knocked down Saddam Hussein and won the war to take him down and his military.\n\n\n\nAnd at this stage, the right thing for us to do is to see if we could possibly stabilize the central government in Iraq so that they can have stability, and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nNot to do that adds an enormous potential risk that the whole region could be embroiled in a regional conflict. BLITZER: Governor, thank you, but the question was, knowing what you know right now -- not what you knew then, what you know right now -- was it a mistake for the United States to invade Iraq?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, I answered the question by saying it's a non- sequitur. It's a non -- null set kind of question, because you can go back and say, \"If we knew then what we know now, by virtue of inspectors having been let in and giving us that information, by virtue of if Saddam Hussein had followed the U.N. resolutions, we wouldn't be having this discussion.\"\n\n\n\nSo it's a hypothetical that I think is an unreasonable hypothetical.\n\n\n\nAnd the answer is: We did what we did. We did the right thing based on what we knew at that time. I think we made mistakes following the conduct or the collapse of Saddam's government.\n\n\n\nFAHEY: Mayor Giuliani, same question to you. Knowing what you know right now, was it a good decision?\n\n\n\nRUDY GIULIANI, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: Absolutely the right thing to do. It's unthinkable that you would leave Saddam Hussein in charge of Iraq and be able to fight the war on terror.\n\n\n\nAnd the problem is that we see Iraq in a vacuum. Iraq should not be seen in a vacuum. Iraq is part of the overall terrorist war against the United States.\n\n\n\nThe problem the Democrats make is they're in denial. That's why you hear things like you heard in the debate the other night, that, you know, Iran really isn't dangerous; it's 10 years away from nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nIran is not 10 years away from nuclear weapons. And the danger to us is not just missiles. The danger to us is a state like Iran handing nuclear weapons over to terrorists.\n\n\n\nSo it has to be seen in that light. And we have to be successful in Iraq.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator McCain, arguably going to war is the most important decision a member of the Senate can make.\n\n\n\nDid you read the national intelligence estimate, which included all the caveats on whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?\n\n\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I did not read that particular document. I received hundreds of briefing, tens and hundreds of hours of study and background and information on it. And the fact is that the sanctions were breaking down. The sanctions were not going to hold. We had a multi-billion dollar scandal in the form of oil for food.\n\n\n\nThe fact is that Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction before on his own people and on his enemies. And if he'd gotten them again, he'd have used them again. That was his commitment and his belief, that he was going to. And we did the right thing.\n\n\n\nThe problem was the mismanagement of the conflict.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nSenator Brownback, you're also a member of the United States Senate. Did you read that classified national intelligence estimate?\n\n\n\nSEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R), KANSAS: I don't remember that report. I had a number of briefings and I held a number of committee hearings. At that time, I was chairing the Middle East Subcommittee on Foreign Relations. And we held hearings on this topic and what was taking place and what Saddam was doing.\n\n\n\nBut the issue is that we've got to put forward, now, a political plan. And that's something I'm going to introduce tomorrow, a political plan to create a three-state solution in Iraq: a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shia state. Because Iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces. And that's what we've lacked is a political plan to get us moving forward in success.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nGovernor Gilmore, let me go to you. You chaired this commission. Do you think it was appropriate that members of Congress would authorize the president to go to war without reading that national intelligence estimate?\n\n\n\nJIM GILMORE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA: You know, I think the people who are in Congress who are responsible for sending this country to war, with the enormous dangers that it has geopolitically and strategically, ought to read at least that kind of material. I know they get a lot of stuff and they can't read everything.\n\n\n\nBut you know what, Wolf? I think the true business is this: The interests of the United States is in creating as much stability as possible in the Middle East. There is a very great danger to this country: our interests in Israel, our interests in energy and in other ways. There is a giant danger of the Middle East becoming an unstable place.\n\n\n\nSaddam Hussein was unstable, and so taking him out was good there. But we certainly didn't anticipate the further instability that was to come after.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to bring all of you in, but I want to go to Scott Spradling of WMUR for the next question.\n\n\n\nSCOTT SPRADLING, WMUR-TV: Thanks, Wolf.\n\n\n\nSenator McCain, we've just spent a few minutes looking back. I'd ask you to look forward now, if you will.\n\n\n\nSince June 1st there have been at least 17 confirmed deaths of American soldiers in Iraq. Approximately 100 U.S. troops are dying there every month. If our top military commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, reports back to Congress this September that the surge hasn't significantly improved the situation on the ground, what then?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: Well, let me say, first of all, I know how frustrated and saddened all Americans are. This morning I was with the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfeboro, who sacrificed his life. And our hearts and our sympathy goes out to all those who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict.\n\n\n\nI (inaudible) think this strategy needs to be given a chance to succeed. We haven't barely gotten the fifth brigade over there, which is part of this strategy.\n\n\n\nI am convinced that if we fail and we have to withdraw, they will follow us home. It will be a base for Al Qaida. And we will be facing greater challenges and greater sacrifices than that already made by Matthew Stanley and his family.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that this will become a base for terrorism, there will be chaos in the region. And when Senator Clinton says this is Mr. Bush's war, that this is President Bush's war -- when President Clinton was in power, I didn't say that Bosnia, our intervention there was President Clinton's war. When we intervened in Kosovo, I didn't say it was President Clinton's war.\n\n\n\nWhat Senator Clinton doesn't understand that presidents don't lose wars. Political parties don't lose wars.\n\n\n\nNations lose wars, and nations lose the -- have the consequences of failure.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: We must succeed in this conflict.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: ... the question was, if General Petraeus says...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n... it's not working so far in September, what do you do then?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: Then you have to examine the options.\n\n\n\nAnd I'll tell you the options: One is the division that Sam described. You would have to divide bedrooms in Baghdad because Sunni and Shia are married to each other. You have 2 million Sunni and 4 million Shia living in Baghdad together.\n\n\n\nYou would have to -- you withdraw to the borders and watch genocide take place inside Baghdad. You watch the destabilization of Jordan. You see further jeopardy of Israel because of the threats of Hezbollah and Iranian hegemony in the region.\n\n\n\nAll of the options I could run through with you. My friend, none of them are good. That's why we must succeed and give it a chance to succeed.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nNow, let me bring in Governor Thompson.\n\n\n\nGo ahead, same question to you: If General Petraeus says it's not working in September, what should the U.S. do then?\n\n\n\nTOMMY THOMPSON, FORMER HHS SECRETARY: The first thing the president should do is demand the al-Maliki government to vote as to whether or not they want the United States to stay in Iraq. We've been there four years. Give the government the responsibility of voting.\n\n\n\nIf they vote \"yes,\" how are they going to help us win this war? If they vote \"no,\" we should redeploy our forces outside.\n\n\n\nSecondly, there are 18 territories in Iraq, geographically defined. Those 18 territories, just like 50 states in America, should elect their state leaders. And if they do so, the Shiites will elect Shiites, Sunnis will elect Sunnis, Kurds will elect Kurds. And you know something? People will go to those particular territories, and you get rid of this civil war internecine.\n\n\n\nNumber three...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right...\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: ... I would like to have the oil revenue proceeds -- very quickly -- oil revenue proceeds split: one-third to the federal government, one-third to the states, and one-third to every man, woman and child. And that will get everybody a stake in their country.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Let me bring in Congressman Duncan Hunter.\n\n\n\nCongressman, if it's not working at that point, how much longer should the United States stay?\n\n\n\nREP. DUNCAN HUNTER (R), CALIFORNIA: Well, Wolf, you know, I read that NIE report, and I held briefings before we made the vote to go in and invited everybody, Democrat and Republican, to get the classified information.\n\n\n\nAnd this depends -- the turnover of the security apparatus depends on one thing: reliable Iraqi forces.\n\n\n\nYou've got 129 Iraqi battalions. We've trained them up. We've got a lot of them in the fight. Over the next three to four months, we need to get them all in the fight, get them that combat capability. When they're combat-hardened, we rotate them in, we displace American heavy combat forces off that battlefield, and Americans come home. And, Wolf...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: ... I can tell you, as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the last four years, I have the credentials to leave Iraq the right way.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Congressman Ron Paul, how much longer should the United States stay in Iraq?\n\n\n\nREP. RON PAUL (R), TEXAS: The sooner we come home, the better. If they declare there's no progress in September, we should come home. It was a mistake to go, so it's a mistake to stay.\n\n\n\nIf we made the wrong diagnosis, we should change the treatment. So we're not making progress there and we should come home.\n\n\n\nThe weapons weren't there and we went in under U.N. resolutions. And our national security was not threatened. We're more threatened now by staying.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor Huckabee, do you have confidence in the government of Iraq...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n... the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, that he's going to do what needs to be done?\n\n\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: I think there's some real doubt about that, Wolf.\n\n\n\nBut I want to remind all of us on this stage and the people in the audience that there's a reason that this is such a struggle. And I think we miss it over here in the West.\n\n\n\nToday's the birthday of Ronald Reagan. We all would believe that Ronald Reagan is the one who ended the Cold War and Ronald Reagan is the one who helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\nBut there's a group of people who don't believe that, and that's the Taliban. They believe they brought about the demise of the Soviet Union because of the way they fought in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nAnd what I want to just mention is that it is not the size of the dog in the fight, it is the size of the fight in the dog. And we underestimate -- grossly underestimate how fierce this dog is and how determined they are to destroy every last one of us.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nCongressman Tom Tancredo, what do you say?\n\n\n\nREP. TOM TANCREDO (R), COLORADO: I'll tell you this, that if it comes to that point in that time that you described, that the surge is apparent that it is not working, I did support it. I hope to God it does work. I hope I'm wrong. I hope we pacify Iraq.\n\n\n\nHowever, if it is apparent that we cannot, then we have to do and tell the Iraqis the exact same thing that Benjamin Franklin said when he came out of the convention in 1787 and somebody said to him, \"Dr. Franklin, what have you given us?\" And he said, \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"\n\n\n\nIt is exactly that time and it is exactly that thing that we have to say to the Iraqi government: \"We have given you this. We bought it with our blood and sweat. It is now up to you to keep it.\"\n\n\n\nAnd I want the Iraqis to be in fact patrolling Baghdad. If they need vehicles, you let them have the vehicles. But I want them patrolling their city and putting their lives at risk.\n\n\n\nThen we move out.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nI want to go to the next question. I want to go back to Tom.\n\n\n\nTom, go ahead.\n\n\n\nFAHEY: Senator Brownback, President Bush has stated that states that sponsor terrorism are no different than terrorists themselves. Yet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently met with Iranian officials to discuss security in Iraq. Iran is a known support of Hezbollah, Hamas.\n\n\n\nDid President Bush make the right call in opening a dialogue with Iran?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: I think he made a right call on saying that about terrorist states, particularly Iran. But I think we have to at times talk with them in different situations.\n\n\n\nLike, before we went into Afghanistan, we talked with Iran. It wasn't we were negotiating. We didn't open up formal diplomatic relations and we shouldn't.\n\n\n\nIran is the lead sponsor of terrorism. Ahmadinejad just this past week called for the destruction of Israel, continues to call for attacking of the United States.\n\n\n\nOn Iraq, I think we need to talk with them. I think we have to confront them aggressively for what they are, which is the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world. I think we need to push the sanctions forward more aggressively. I think we need to work with the labor union movement that's developing inside of Iran. You had a bus driver strike that recently took place.\n\n\n\nAnd I think we have to show that purpose and resolve, that we're going to confront these guys and we're going to stand with our allies like Israel, we're going to stand against them oppressing and pushing us, and trying to fund terrorists against us.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nCongressman Hunter, let me bring...\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: Senator, if you don't mind.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Excuse me, Senator.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: That's OK.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Congressman Hunter, let me bring you back in. Do you agree with Senator Brownback that President Bush made the right decision in opening a direct dialogue with Iran?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: With two conditions. And I think that you do have a dialogue with everybody, whether they're adversaries or friends.\n\n\n\nThe two conditions are: Number one, they are moving deadly equipment across the border that is killing Americans in Iraq.\n\n\n\nWe have license to utilize anything that we want to use: special operations, intelligence, whatever it takes to stop that deadly equipment from moving across the border and hitting Americans in Iraq. And we don't give that up with these talks.\n\n\n\nSecondly, they've got about 1,000 centrifuges now working, enriching the material that can make, at some point, a nuclear device. The United States reserves the right to preempt, and we may have to preempt that nuclear weapons program. We cannot allow them to have a nuclear device.\n\n\n\nWith those two caveats, talk to your enemies.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: If it came down to a preemptive U.S. strike against Iran's nuclear facility if necessary, would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: I would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges.\n\n\n\nWhen the Osirak reactor was hit in '86, when the six F-18s came over the horizon and knocked that out, they didn't need anything but conventional weapons.\n\n\n\nProbably it's going to take a little more than that. I don't think it's going to take tactical nukes.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: What do you think, Mayor? Do you think, if you were president of the United States and it came down to Iran having a nuclear bomb, which you say is unacceptable, you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Part of the premise of talking to Iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the United States that they have nuclear power. I think it could be done with conventional weapons, but you can't rule out anything and you shouldn't take any option off the table.\n\n\n\nAnd during the debate the other night, the Democrats seemed to be back in the 1990s. They don't seem to have gotten beyond the Cold War. Iran is a threat, a nuclear threat, not just because they can deliver a nuclear warhead with missiles. They're a nuclear threat because they are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism and they can hand nuclear materials to terrorists.\n\n\n\nAnd we just saw it just last week in New York, an attempt by Islamist terrorists to attack JFK airport; three weeks ago, an attempt to attack Fort Dix.\n\n\n\nThese are real problems. This war is not a bumper sticker. This war is a real war.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Let me bring Governor Gilmore in.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if that's what it takes to go deep underground and destroy those Iraqi facilities?\n\n\n\nGILMORE: One of the central problems of the Middle East is the desire for Iran to dominate that portion of the world, because of what they are doing. And that is why I believe that they are seeking this kind of nuclear capacity. That is one of the reasons why we are, in fact, in Iraq.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why our soldiers, when they fight and die there, are in fact serving the interests of the United States. Nobody ought to have any doubt about that.\n\n\n\nWith respect to Iran, the policy I would follow would be dual.\n\n\n\nNumber one, we need to work with our European allies in order to put in appropriate sanctions. We need to communicate directly with the Iranians that we are going to offer them an opportunity to work with us.\n\n\n\nBut we are also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable; they need to understand it. And all options are on the table by the United States in that instance.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right. Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, I want to get you on the record. Do you agree with the mayor, the governor, others here, that the use of tactical nuclear weapons, potentially, would be possible if that were the only way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: You don't take options off the table, but what you do is stand back and say, \"What's going on here?\" You see what's happening in Sudan and Afghanistan, in Iraq and Iran. All over the world, we're seeing the same thing happening, and that is people are testing the United States of America. And we have to make sure they understand that we're not arrogant; we have resolve. And we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty.\n\n\n\nFor that to happen, we're going to have to not just attack each one of these problems one by one, but say, how do we help move the world of Islam so that the moderate Muslims can reject the extreme?\n\n\n\nAnd for that to happen, we're going to have to have a strong military and an effort to combine with our allies in such a way, we combine for an effort to help move Islam toward modernity.\n\n\n\nThat's what we're going to have to do, instead of looking at each theater one by one and saying, \"We'll bomb here, we'll attack here, we'll go to Sudan.\"\n\n\n\nI watched the Democrats...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: ... they don't think there's a war on terror.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: There's a war going on, and we need a broad response to make sure that these people have a different vision.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nAll of you are going to have an opportunity to weigh on all of these questions as well.\n\n\n\nIf you're hearing some sounds out there, it's lightning here in Manchester, New Hampshire. Those are the crackling sounds that you're hearing.\n\n\n\nLet's go back to Scott.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: Thanks, Wolf.\n\n\n\nCongressman Tancredo, let's talk immigration.\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: OK.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: You oppose the immigration reform compromise, calling it, quote, \"the worst piece of legislation to come down the pike in a long time.\" Just this morning in Manchester, you vowed to oust any senator who supports the bill, including possibly New Hampshire's senior Senator Judd Gregg, who's undecided, and says to your comments that you are part of the know-nothing wing of the political spectrum.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the president says his plan is the last best chance for serious immigration reform.\n\n\n\nHe's criticized conservatives for being obstructionists.\n\n\n\nWith that tension at stake, if this becomes law, what are the consequences for the country?\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: They are incredible, and they are disastrous.\n\n\n\nAnd that is exactly why I have said what I've said, and that is why I have consistently tried to impress upon the American public the seriousness of this issue.\n\n\n\nWe're not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country. We're not just talking about that.\n\n\n\nWe're talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation: whether or not we will actually survive as a nation.\n\n\n\nAnd here's what I mean by that.\n\n\n\nWhat we're doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces.\n\n\n\nWe are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the English language, something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation.\n\n\n\nWe are becoming a bilingual nation. And that is not good.\n\n\n\nAnd that is the fearful part of this. The ramifications are much, much more significant than any that we've been discussing so far.\n\n\n\nAnd so, yes, I have said dramatic things. And, yes, I am willing to do whatever is necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation. And that includes go after any Republican that votes for it, because the Republicans can stop this.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nMayor Giuliani, what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by President Bush goes through?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: The problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose. It's a typical Washington mess. It's everybody compromises -- four or five compromises.\n\n\n\nAnd the compromises leave you with the following conclusion: The litmus test you should have for legislation is, is it going to make things better? And when you look at these compromises, it is quite possible it will make things worse. The organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country.\n\n\n\nThey should have a tamper-proof I.D. card. It should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are, why they're here, make sure they're not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose, and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database.\n\n\n\nWe can do that. Credit card companies...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: ... take care of data that is greater than that.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\nI want to get to Senator McCain in a moment, but first, Governor Romney, Senator McCain has accused you of flip-flopping on this issue, in effect.\n\n\n\nYesterday in Miami, he said the following: \"Pandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing. And doing nothing is silent amnesty.\"\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to Senator McCain?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, he's my friend. He campaigned for me two times. I consider him a friend. I'm not going to make this a matter of personal politics. It's an issue that's way too important for that.\n\n\n\nMy view is that we should enforce our immigration laws.\n\n\n\nAnd this bill, unfortunately, has at least one provision that's a real problem. It's the Z visa.\n\n\n\nAnd what it allows is people who have come here illegally to stay here for the rest of their lives -- not necessarily as citizens; they have to wait 13 years to become citizens. That's not the point.\n\n\n\nThe point is: Every illegal alien, almost every one, under this bill, gets to stay here. That's not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here, join with family members, bring skill and education that we need.\n\n\n\nIt's simply not fair to say those people get put ahead in the line of all the people who've been waiting legally to come to this country.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right, Senator McCain, this is your chance. I'd like you to respond as someone who is the co-author of this legislation.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: Well, first of all, I agree with Judd Gregg. He's a great senator.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nSecond of all, Rudy, you just described our legislation, so I'd be glad to have further conversation with you, because it does account for people who are here illegally.\n\n\n\nIt does have an employment verification system. And it weeds out those who shouldn't be here, and it gives others a chance to remain in this country.\n\n\n\nLook, this is a national security issue, first and foremost. Ever since 9/11, it's a national security issue.\n\n\n\nPeople came to Fort Dix, New Jersey, from across our southern border and tried to kill our soldiers.\n\n\n\nFor us to do nothing is silent and de facto amnesty.\n\n\n\nWhat we have done is what you expect us to do, my friends, and that's come together with the president of the United States, the leader of our party, Democrat and Republican, conservative Republicans like Jon Kyl, Johnny Isakson, Saxby Chambliss and Trent Lott, and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem.\n\n\n\nAnd it is a serious national security problem.\n\n\n\nWe need to act, my friends. And if someone else has a better idea, I'd love to have them pursue -- give it to us.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nHold on.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: That can get...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: ... a better idea!\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: That will get the support of enough people so that we can pass legislation.\n\n\n\nThis isn't the bill that I would have written, but it does...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right. Thank you.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: ... it does satisfy our national security challenges, which are severe and intense. And we cannot 12 million people washing around America illegally, my friends. (CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: And I hope you'll examine the legislation.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: And I hope we can move forward with it. And we can make it better.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: But it's our job to do the hard things...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Mayor, go ahead.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: ... not the easy things.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I've read the 400 pages. And this is part of the problem in Washington: They say things and then it's not in the legislation.\n\n\n\nThere are four or five different methods of identification, not one.\n\n\n\nIt does not provide information about who exited the United States. Now, tell me how you're going to figure out who's in the United States if you can't figure out who's left the United States.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, it doesn't provide for a uniform database. Many countries have this. The United States doesn't have it.\n\n\n\nOn September 11th, when we tried to figure out who was in this country, it took weeks to figure out who were the right people and who weren't, because there isn't such a database. And that is a fatal flaw in this legislation. And wishing it away doesn't make it possible.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor Romney, what would you do with the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are, right now, in this country?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, one is to enforce the law as it exists. The law that was passed in 1986...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThe law passed in 1986 asked for us to secure the border and said also to put in place an employment verification system.\n\n\n\nNeither one of those was done. So let's make sure that we enforce the law as it exists.\n\n\n\nAnd if you want to improve this bill, well, one thing you could do to make it better is to take that Z visa and make it temporary instead of a permanent right to stay in America. That's simply just not fair.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I want to stay on immigration. Everybody's going to have a chance to weigh in. But let's go back to Tom for another question on immigration.\n\n\n\nFAHEY: Congressman Hunter, whether we like it or not, in cities across America, counties across America, including your district in San Diego, illegal immigrants are doing jobs that American citizens don't want, working on farms, in hotels, restaurants.\n\n\n\nIf you have your way and they all leave this country, who's going to fill those jobs?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: Well, first, I disagree with that premise, because when they made the sweep on the Swift plants -- those were the meat- packaging plants in Iowa; took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago -- there were American citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour.\n\n\n\nAnd let me tell you, this is a disastrous bill. And John McCain is right in saying that this is a national security issue. And it is: border enforcement.\n\n\n\nThen the Hunter bill, which was signed by the president on the 26th of October, mandating 854 miles of double fence -- not that scraggly, little fence you show on CNN all the time, Wolf, that people get across so easily.\n\n\n\nIf they get across my fence, we sign them up for the Olympics immediately.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nWe've got a big fence.\n\n\n\nBut 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed. Homeland Security has a billion bucks, cash on hand. It's been six months, and they've done 11 miles.\n\n\n\nSo this administration has a case of the slows. And I think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time, put the two together, and the Bush-McCain-Kennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike.\n\n\n\nIt's a bad bill.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nSenator Brownback, what do you say about this notion of a pathway toward citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now? Under what circumstances would you let them begin that path?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: I don't think you create any new paths to citizenship. But I also think you allow them to be able to use paths that they would currently qualify for, and to be able to get in the back of the line. And that's part of leadership and getting something resolved.\n\n\n\nI think, you know, we can go on a lot of slogans here. And I've been around this issue for a while. I was in Congress in 1994, elected then. We did the first immigration bill I was involved in then in 1996.\n\n\n\nYou know what? That was an enforcement-only bill in 1996. And we had 7 million undocumented here in the country then. We're at 12 million to 20 million now.\n\n\n\nThe point of saying that -- and my colleagues and people up here, everybody is concerned that we get something done and get something right.\n\n\n\nI think if you do exterior enforcement, border enforcement, you do aggressive interior enforcement, and then you work on a comprehensive solution interior, that's something that a lot of people are going to be upset with but that can work and move us forward. And it's better than not doing anything.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. So you support this pending compromise legislation?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: If we can hold together those things in it. Those things have to be in it.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You're with Senator McCain.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: If those things are in it.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: What about you, Governor Thompson?\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: Wolf, the first thing you have to do is you've got to secure the border. Securing the border is going to allow everything else to follow.\n\n\n\nBut unless you secure the border, it is not right to give 12 million individuals who have illegal rights in this country status before that border is protected.\n\n\n\nThere should be no amnesty. And this bill, no matter how you cover it, is an amnesty bill.\n\n\n\nAnd the people in this country do not believe in that bill. And they believe very much that the best hope for us to have a secure border, just like Congressman Hunter has been talking about and every other Republican up here.\n\n\n\nHave a secure border, then move on. But don't do it the other way. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nCongressman Paul, I want you to weigh in on this as well. I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- you voted to support that 700-mile fence along the border between the United States and Mexico. Did you?\n\n\n\nPAUL: I did.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: What about Canada? Is there a need for a similar fence along the border between...\n\n\n\nPAUL: No.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: ... the United States and Canada?\n\n\n\nPAUL: No, because that bill -- probably the fence was my weakest reason for doing that, but for other reasons, to enforce the law was important. And border security is important.\n\n\n\nAnd we talked about amnesty, which I'm positively opposed to.\n\n\n\nBut one thing that has not been mentioned here, which I think is very, very important: If you subsidize something, you get more of it. So we subsidize illegal immigration. We reward it by easy citizenship, either birthright or amnesty. But we force our states and our local communities to pay for the health care, to pay for the education. Why wouldn't they bring their families?\n\n\n\nAnd because of our economic conditions, we do need workers. But if we had a truly free-market economy, the illegal immigrants would not be the scapegoat. We would probably need them, and they would be acceptable. But because of economic conditions, they have become the scapegoat.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: The other night, Sunday night, I asked the eight Democratic presidential candidates whether or not they thought English should be the official language of the United States. Only one of them said English should be the official language of the United States.\n\n\n\nIf there's someone here who doesn't believe English should be the official language of the United States, please speak up right now.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: I think it's fine.\n\n\n\nI would like to remind you that we made treaties with Native Americans such as the Navajos in my state, where we respect their sovereignty and they use their native language in their deliberations. It's not a big deal. But Native Americans are important to me in my state.\n\n\n\nEverybody knows that English has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder. That is obvious.\n\n\n\nAnd part of our legislation, by the way, is a requirement to learn English.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, 30 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never came across our borders, my friends. They overstayed their visas. That's why it has to be a comprehensive approach.\n\n\n\nAnd I'm proud of the support of the president and his brother, Governor Jeb Bush, who was governor of the state of Florida. People who have to deal with this issue every day understand we have to act, my friends.\n\n\n\nAnd we can have our own ways to improve it. But if we don't address this issue, we are going to pay a heavy price. Because something bad could happen when 12 million people are in this country illegally, 2 million of them having committed serious crimes.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I see people raising their hands.\n\n\n\nBut the question was, I'd only like those to speak up who believe that English should not necessarily be the official language of the United States.\n\n\n\nIs there anyone else who stands with Senator McCain specifically on that question?\n\n\n\nAll right. We're going to go back to Scott.\n\n\n\nGo ahead, Scott.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Scott, go ahead.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: Wolf, if I've got -- if I have reservations in my district, can I speak up also?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You'll have an opportunity.\n\n\n\nGo ahead, Scott.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: OK. This question's for Governor Gilmore.\n\n\n\nConservative credentials is the topic, sir. You've gotten a lot of mileage out of lumping Messrs. Giuliani, McCain and Romney together by calling them Rudy McRomney.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nNow, with former Senator Fred Thompson likely to join you at the next debate, in your opinion, is he conservative enough for America or are we changing the name now to Rudy McRomneyson?\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nGILMORE: Well, we've gotten a little mileage out of Rudy McRomney. I know the mayor one time said that it would make a good ticket, and it would. But it isn't a conservative ticket. And we don't know what Fred Thompson is either.\n\n\n\nI think he's a fine man. He served in the Senate a term and a half. Let's see exactly what his views are.\n\n\n\nI'm coming forward and offering my views as a 40-year battler for conservative values and conservative principles on behalf of the people of the United States.\n\n\n\nAnd I have the record to back it up. I've been a prosecutor. I've been an attorney general. I've been a governor. I governed as a conservative. I cut taxes for the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I've stood by these principles for years and years.\n\n\n\nThe question is that when Fred Thompson comes into the race, as I believe he will -- and maybe even Speaker Gingrich may come into the race. They'll have to stand on their records and stand on their credentials and offer their ideas the same way that every person here on the stage is doing.\n\n\n\nI look forward to that day, and I look forward to the debate.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nGovernor Thompson, is there a need for another Thompson in this race?\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: I think that anybody with a Thompson name should get involved if they want to get involved. It's a great name. He's a great candidate. And I think it will help the Republican Party to have him in.\n\n\n\nI just would like to say that if you're talking about conservatism -- and that's what you're talking about -- there isn't a candidate on either side of the aisle that has had as many vetoes as I have.\n\n\n\nNobody has reduced taxes as much as I have.\n\n\n\nAnd if you're talking about a reliable conservative, it is this Thompson, Tommy Thompson, not the other, that's the conservative.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nMayor Giuliani, there was some news here today. A Catholic bishop in Rhode Island said some words about your position on abortion, suggesting that it was similar to Pontius Pilate's personal opposition to Jesus Christ's crucifixion, but allowing it to happen anyway. How does that make you feel when you hear words like that from a Catholic bishop?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Well, Catholic bishop -- any religion (inaudible).\n\n\n\nBLITZER: That's the lightning that's having an effect on our system.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I know.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nI guess I'm here by myself.\n\n\n\nLook, for someone who went to parochial schools all his life, this is a very frightening thing that's happening right now.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBut the reality is I respect, you know, the opinion of Catholic (inaudible) and religious leaders of all kinds. Religion is very important to me. It's a very important part of my life.\n\n\n\nBut ultimately, as (inaudible) been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law, I've got to make the decisions that I think are the right ones in a country like ours.\n\n\n\nAnd my view on abortion is that it's wrong, but that ultimately government should not be enforcing that decision on a woman.\n\n\n\nThat is my view that I -- I consult my religion. I consult my reading of the Constitution. I consult my views of what I think are important in a pluralistic society, and the reality that we have to respect the fact that there are people that are equally as religious, equally as moral, that make a different decision about this, and should government put them in jail?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You made, Governor Romney, this decision on abortion, opposing abortion, relatively recently.\n\n\n\nWhy should conservatives out there, people who oppose abortion, believe you?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, people can look at my record. I'm not going to apologize for the fact that I became pro-life. I served as governor. As I was governor, as we were debating cloning and as we were debating also embryo farming, I said Roe v. Wade has gone too far.\n\n\n\nI want to make it very clear that I'm pro-life. People here in New Hampshire have seen that I fought for life. I fought also for traditional marriage, to keep taxes down, to have education in our schools that includes abstinence education. I've fought for English immersion in our schools.\n\n\n\nThey know that I've got conservative credentials. And that's one of the things that brings me to this race.\n\n\n\nBut there's something bigger in conservatism that I don't think we've spoken about. And that is that America is a land of opportunity. And our future is going to be far brighter than our past, not just as we overcome these challenges, but as we take advantage of the new opportunity of the 21st century.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor.\n\n\n\nLet's go back to Tom for the next question.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nFAHEY: (inaudible) do not believe in evolution. You're an ordained minister. What do you believe? Is it the story of creation, as it is reported in the Bible or described in the Bible?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: It's interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president. I'm not planning on writing the curriculum for an 8th-grade science book. I'm asking for the opportunity to be president of the United States.\n\n\n\nBut you've raised the question, so let me answer it.\n\n\n\nIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth. To me, it's pretty simple. A person either believes that God created this process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own.\n\n\n\nAnd the basic question was an unfair question, because it simply asked us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed, in my view, whether there is a God or not.\n\n\n\nWell, let me be very clear: I believe there is a God. I believe there's a God who was active in the creation process.\n\n\n\nNow, how did he do it and when did he do it and how long did he take, I don't honestly know. And I don't think knowing that would make me a better or a worse president.\n\n\n\nBut I'll tell you what I can tell this country: If they want a president who doesn't believe in God, there's probably plenty of choices. But if I'm selected as president of this country, they'll have one who believes in those words that God did create.\n\n\n\nAnd as the words of Martin Luther, here I stand. I can do no other. And I will not take that back.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor, but I think the specific question is, do you believe literally it was done in six days and it occurred 6,000 years ago?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: No, I did answer that, Wolf. I said, I don't know.\n\n\n\nMy point is, I don't know. I wasn't there.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER) But I believe, whether God did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time, he did it. And that's what's important.\n\n\n\nBut, you know, if anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate, they are certainly welcome to do it. I don't know how far they will march that back.\n\n\n\nBut I believe that all of us in this room are the unique creations of a god who knows us and loves us, and who created us for his own purpose.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator Brownback, you recently elaborated on your position on this, and I wonder if you'd want to spend 30 seconds and tell our audience out there where you stand on the issue of evolution.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: I'd be happy to.\n\n\n\nAnd it's interesting that we're doing this here at St. Anselm's, who this -- that saint had a philosophy of faith seeking reason.\n\n\n\nAnd that's the issue that's missing here, if I could highlight that point, is that I believe that we are created in the image of God for a particular purpose. And I believe that with all my heart.\n\n\n\nAnd I'm somebody, I've had cancer in the past, I've had a season to really look at this and study it and think about the end of life. And I am fully convinced there's a god of the universe that loves us very much and was involved in the process.\n\n\n\nHow he did it, I don't know.\n\n\n\nOne of the problems we have with our society today is that we've put faith and science at odds with each other. They aren't at odds with each other. If they are, check your faith or check your science, and we should have a discussion.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: And we should engage faith and reason like St. Anselm did.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: That's something we should do.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator Brownback.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nSenator McCain, do you believe creationism should be taught alongside evolution in the nation's schools?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: No, I believe that that's up to the school districts. But I think that every American should be exposed to all theories.\n\n\n\nBut I can't say it more eloquently than Pastor Huckabee -- Governor Huckabee just did. And I admire his description because I hold that view.\n\n\n\nThe point is that the time before time, there's no doubt in my mind that the hand of God was in what we are today. And I do believe that we are unique, and I believe that God loves us. But I also believe that all of our children in school can be taught different views on different issues.\n\n\n\nBut I leave the curricula up to the school boards.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator, for that.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, there was a recent poll here in New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nTen percent said they wouldn't vote for you because you're a Mormon. And last week, we saw that picture of that man who refused to shake your hand because you are a Mormon.\n\n\n\nWhat would you like to say to the voters out there tonight about your faith, about yourself and about God?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, President Kennedy some time ago said he was not a Catholic running for president, he was an American running for president. And I'm happy to be a proud member of my faith.\n\n\n\nYou know, I think it's a fair question for people to ask, what do you believe? And I think if you want to understand what I believe, you could recognize that the values that I have are the same values you'll find in faiths across this country.\n\n\n\nI believe in God, believe in the Bible, believe Jesus Christ is my savior. I believe that God created man in his image. I believe that the freedoms of man derive from inalienable rights that were given to us by God.\n\n\n\nAnd I also believe that there are some pundits out there that are hoping that I'll distance myself from my church so that that'll help me politically. And that's not going to happen.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor, for that.\n\n\n\nCongressman Paul, you ran for president once before as a libertarian. What do you say about this whole issue of church and state and these issues that are coming forward right now?\n\n\n\nPAUL: Well, I think we should read the First Amendment, where it says, \"Congress shall write no law,\" and we should write a lot less laws regarding this matter. It shouldn't be a matter of the president or the Congress. It should be local people, local officials.\n\n\n\nThe state should determine so many of these things that we just don't need more laws determining religious things or prayer in schools. We should allow people at the local level. That's what the Constitution tells us.\n\n\n\nWe don't need somebody in Washington telling us what we can do, because we don't have perfect knowledge. And that's the magnificence of our Constitution and our republic. We sort out the difficult problems at local levels, and we don't have, you know, one-case-fit- all.\n\n\n\nBecause you have a Supreme Court ruling, like on Roe v. Wade, it ruined it for the whole country. And that's why we shouldn't have it at a central level.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nLet's go back to another question from Tom.\n\n\n\nFAHEY: This is for Mayor Giuliani.\n\n\n\nSea levels around the world are rising. Average temperatures are increasing. A U.N. report written by scientists from 113 countries recently said that climate change is very likely man-made and may affect us for centuries to come.\n\n\n\nIs science wrong on global warming? And what, if any, steps would you take as president to address the issue of climate change?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I think we have to accept the view that scientists have, that there is global warming, and that human operation, human condition contributes to that.\n\n\n\nAnd the fact is that there is a way to deal with it and to address it in a way that we can also accomplish energy independence, which we need as a matter of national security.\n\n\n\nIt's frustrating and really dangerous for us to see money going to our enemies because we have to buy oil from certain countries. We should be supporting all the alternatives.\n\n\n\nWe need a project similar to putting a man on the moon. That project started with Eisenhower. It was carried out by Kennedy and then Johnson and then Nixon. And that was two Democrats and two Republicans working (inaudible) Democrats working in the national interest.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\nI want Governor Romney to weigh in as well.\n\n\n\nThere's a perception, at least among some, that Republicans are -- at least the Republican Party -- very close to big oil. A lot of Americans are suffering now from the price of gasoline -- high price of gasoline. What do you say to the audience out there who believes that there's too much of an alliance, if you will, between the big oil companies and Republicans?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, first of all, Rudy Giuliani is right, in terms of an Apollo project to get us to energy independent. And the effects of that on global warming are positive. It's a no-regrets policy. It's a great idea.\n\n\n\nSecondly, with regards to big oil, big oil is making a lot of money right now. And I'd like to see them using that money to invest in refineries.\n\n\n\nDon't forget that when companies earn profit, that money's supposed to be reinvested in growth. And our refineries are old.\n\n\n\nSomeone said to me -- Matt Simmons, an investment banker down in Houston -- he said, \"Our refineries today are rust, with paint holding them up.\"\n\n\n\nAnd we need to see these companies, if they're making that kind of money, reinvest in capital equipment.\n\n\n\nBut let's not forget that where the money is being made this year is not just -- and throughout these years -- is not just in Exxon and Shell and the major oil companies. It's in the countries that own this oil.\n\n\n\nRussia last year took in $500 billion by selling oil. Ahmadinejad, Putin, Chavez -- these people are getting rich off of people buying too much oil.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why we have to pursue, as a strategic imperative, energy independence for America.\n\n\n\nAnd it takes that Apollo project. It also takes biodiesel, biofuel, ethanol...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: ... cellulosic ethanol, nuclear power, more drilling in ANWR.\n\n\n\nWe have to be serious also about efficiency.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: And that's going to allow us to become energy- independent.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator McCain, do you have a problem at this time with these oil companies making these huge profits?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: Sure. I think we all do. And they ought to be reinvesting it. And one of the areas that they ought to be involved in is nuclear power. Nuclear power is safe. Nuclear power is green, does not emit greenhouse gases. Nuclear power is used on Navy ships which have sailed around the world for 60 years without an accident.\n\n\n\nAnd of course we ought to be investing in alternate energy sources.\n\n\n\nRecently there was a group of retired military officers who said that climate change and energy independence is a national security issue. It is. We've got to reduce our dependence on imported oil.\n\n\n\nWe can do it through a wide variety of alternative fuels. But we have to be serious about it and we're going to have to go to places where we have never gone before. And nuclear power is one of the major issues, but also all kinds of ethanol as well.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nLet me bring Congressman Paul back into this conversation.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, President Bush signed an energy bill that provided billions of dollars in tax break subsidies to the oil companies, with the goal of boosting domestic production. At a time of these record profits, do you believe these companies need a helping hand from the federal government?\n\n\n\nPAUL: I don't think the profits is the issue. The profits are OK if they're legitimately earned in a free market. What I object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them R&D money. I don't think that should be that way. They should take it out of the funds that they earn.\n\n\n\nBut also, you can't discuss energy without discussing our foreign policy.\n\n\n\nWhy do we go to the Middle East? We know the oil is very important about the Middle East and why we're there. Why did we, our government, help overthrow Mosaddeq in 1953? It had to do with oil.\n\n\n\nSo, our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests.\n\n\n\nThe profits, that's not the problem. It's the problem that we succumb to the temptation to protect oil interests by literally going out and fighting wars over oil.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor Gilmore, you agree?\n\n\n\nGILMORE: I agree that if you make profits of the open marketplace, that that's an appropriate thing to do. I also believe that they should be going in and putting this additional money into additional drilling, into additional exploration.\n\n\n\nBut it's going to have to be bigger than that. We're going to have to in fact look to all sources: ethanol, biomass, coal, clean coal, the opportunities for natural gas, and nuclear power. And by the way, nuclear power will help this whole issue of global warming.\n\n\n\nAnd one more point in direct answer to your question: The Kyoto treaty was, in fact, fatally flawed. That was a treaty that in fact was going to basically just transfer our money directly to Russia for nothing, because they were going to get credits because simply that their economy had declined.\n\n\n\nThe truth is, we're going to have to get a program in place, an international diplomatic answer, that is going to include every nation of the world in this entire project. And that includes China and India.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\nLet me bring Scott back for the next question.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: Congressman Paul, a question for you.\n\n\n\nMost of our closest allies, including Great Britain and Israel, allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military. Is it time to end don't ask/don't tell policy and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the U.S. military?\n\n\n\nPAUL: I think the current policy is a decent policy.\n\n\n\nAnd the problem that we have with dealing with this subject is we see people as groups, as they belong to certain groups and that they derive their rights as belonging to groups.\n\n\n\nWe don't get our rights because we're gays or women or minorities. We get our rights from our creator as individuals. So every individual should be treated the same way.\n\n\n\nSo if there is homosexual behavior in the military that is disruptive, it should be dealt with.\n\n\n\nBut if there's heterosexual sexual behavior that is disruptive, it should be dealt with.\n\n\n\nSo it isn't the issue of homosexuality. It's the concept and the understanding of individual rights. If we understood that, we would not be dealing with this very important problem.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor Huckabee, I want you to weigh in as well.\n\n\n\nDo you believe it's time to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the United States military?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Wolf, I think it's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct. I think that's what Congressman Paul was saying: It's about conduct; it's not about attitude.\n\n\n\nBut I'd like to ask you. You said a moment ago that you were going to all give us a chance to deal with the issue of immigration.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to come back to that.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: And I hope you'll do that.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We will. We'll come back to immigration.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: You held us to it, and now I want to hold you to it, so...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to come back...\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: ... if you could give us that opportunity.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're going to come back to immigration.\n\n\n\nBut right now, we're talking about allowing gays to serve openly in the military. But you're opposed to that?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: I just said I think it's a matter -- it's not -- you don't punish people for their attitudes; you punish them if their behavior creates a problem. And it's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: So you wouldn't change existing policy.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: What?\n\n\n\nBLITZER: You wouldn't change existing policy.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: I don't think that I would. I think it's already covered by the existing policy that we do have, in fact.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, recently we've learned that several talented trained linguists -- Arabic speakers, Farsi speakers, Urdu speakers -- trained by the U.S. government to learn those languages to help us in the war on terrorism, were dismissed from the military because they announced they were gays or lesbians.\n\n\n\nIs that, in your mind, appropriate?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: This is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this.\n\n\n\nBack in 1994 we went through this. And it created a tremendous amount of disruption. Colin Powell, I think, was still the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before he left at the beginning of the Clinton administration.\n\n\n\nHe came to the view that this was a good policy.\n\n\n\nAnd I think in time of war, in a time where we're trying to deal with this transition to a new kind of warfare that we have to be fighting -- and we haven't gotten all the way there yet. We need a hybrid army, we need to look at nation-building as part of what we have to teach our military. I don't think this would be the right time to raise these issues.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: And I think we should rely on the judgment of our commanders in a situation like this. They know what's disruptive and what's not. And at a time of war, you don't make fundamental changes like this.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, the mayor referred to the don't ask/don't tell policy, which was implemented during the Clinton administration, after Bill Clinton became president.\n\n\n\nIn 1994, you were quoted as saying that you advocated gays being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation's military.\n\n\n\nThe question to you is, do you still feel that way?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: No, actually when I first heard of the don't ask/don't tell policy I thought it sounded awfully silly and didn't think that'd be very effective, and I turned out to be wrong.\n\n\n\nIt's been the policy now in the military for, what, 10, 15 years? And it seems to be working.\n\n\n\nAnd I agree with what Mayor Giuliani said, that this is not the time to put in place a major change, a social experiment, in the middle of a war going on.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't change it at this point. We can look at it down the road. But it does seem to me that we have much bigger issues as a nation that we ought to be talking about than that policy right now.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator McCain, you've been involved in military matters virtually your whole life. What do you say?\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: We have the best-trained, most professional, best- equipped, most efficient, most wonderful military in the history of this country. And I'm proud of every one of them.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThere just aren't enough of them. So I have to rely on our military leadership, in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young Americans in combat as we speak.\n\n\n\nSo I think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue. It is working, my friends. The policy is working.\n\n\n\nAnd I am convinced that that's the way we can maintain this greatest military. As much as I revere the greatest generation, as much as I love my own generation, this is the very best. Let's not tamper with them.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Is there anyone here who believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the United States military?\n\n\n\nIf you do, speak up now.\n\n\n\nScott, go ahead with your question.\n\n\n\nSPRADLING: Gentlemen, last night, we asked Democrats, if they were elected, what role would they use former President Clinton? I'm not going to ask you that.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBut, Governor Thompson, I'd like to know, seeing as how you were a member of President Bush's Cabinet as health and human services secretary, how would you use George W. Bush in your administration?\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: I certainly would not send him to the United Nations.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nI believe George W. Bush has tremendous characteristics. He's very honest. He's very straightforward.\n\n\n\nI would put him out on a lecture series, talking to the youth of America about honesty, integrity, perseverance, passion, and serving the public.\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush believes very much in public service, as does his father, as does his brothers, as does his mother.\n\n\n\nI think he could be a wonderful spokesperson, making sure that young people realize that public service is a very noble cause and something that young people should aspire to, like all the young people here on this campus should also have the opportunity to serve in public life.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator Brownback, same question to you: If you're elected president, what would you ask your predecessor to do?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: Well, I would talk with him about it first, and I would ask him about it. I think he would probably take a position the way his dad did, saying, \"You know, I think you need to have your time in the limelight. And I will be willing to help out if you have a tragedy overseas.\"\n\n\n\nHis father has been excellent, in the tsunami that hit Sri Lanka and other places, in helping fund-raising.\n\n\n\nHe's been a wonderful ambassador in those sorts of situations.\n\n\n\nAnd frankly, I think that's the right role for an ex-president. And I really think, in many respects, President Clinton has not assumed the right role of an ex-president, where he's injected himself a lot more on policy issues that haven't been appropriate, and he really should defer more to the person that's in the job.\n\n\n\nThere's one person that's president at a time, and that's the way it should be.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Congressman Tancredo, I see you anxious to weigh in.\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: Thank you.\n\n\n\nSome time ago, in 2003 I think it was, that I got a call from Karl Rove, who told me that, because of my criticism of the president, I should never darken the doorstep of the White House.\n\n\n\nI have been so disappointed in the president in so many ways since his -- actually for the last several years, not just the immigration issue, but several other things, including the No Child Left Behind and the massive increase in government that we call prescription drug -- Medicare prescription drug, that I'm afraid I would have to tell the president of the United States -- I mean, as president, I would have to tell George Bush exactly the same thing Karl Rove told me.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nGovernor Huckabee...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n... you served, as you reminded us, a long time as a governor, Republican governor of Arkansas. Your old job is now in Democratic hands. Here in New Hampshire, the GOP has suffered some significant losses as well. And the Republicans lost the majority in the House and the Senate, as you well know.\n\n\n\nSimple question: What's happened to the GOP?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Lost credibility, because we didn't do what we were hired to do.\n\n\n\nWhen you're elected, you're hired to do a job. You're hired to cut spending, lower taxes, bring more government back to the local people. We did the polar opposite. And the people fired us.\n\n\n\nAnd I think, in many ways, though there were some good people that got caught up in the tsunami of the 2006 elections, the Republican Party, as a whole, deserved to get beat.\n\n\n\nWe've lost credibility, the way we bungled Katrina, the fact that there was corruption that was unchecked in Washington, and the fact that there was a feeling that there was not a proper handling of the Iraqi war in all of its details, and the indifference to people pouring over our borders.\n\n\n\nAnd let me just add this, Wolf. There are a lot of people for whom the immigration issue is like a lot of them. They see Washington not taking the kind of positions to build a fence, and they know that when they go to the airport to get on an airplane, they have to show photo I.D., they have to go through layers of security, and they don't understand why someone across an international border doesn't have to do the same thing.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCongressman Hunter, I want to just -- because he raised the issue -- he raised the issue of corruption.\n\n\n\nDo you think it would be appropriate for President Bush to pardon Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, who was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for his role in the CIA leak case?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: You know, I think, Wolf, to make a determination on that, you'd have to look at the transcript.\n\n\n\nI'll tell you a couple of transcripts I have looked at, and that's the agents, Compean and Ramos, who were given 11 and 12 years respectively for stopping a drug dealer bringing 750 pounds of drugs across the border.\n\n\n\nI've looked at their transcript; I would pardon Compean and Ramos right now.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nAnd let me say, with respect to what Mike said, we've got to bring back the Reagan Democrats to this party, because we need the Reagan Democrats for Republican leadership to work.\n\n\n\nAnd we're going to have to get a good trade bill that brings jobs back to this country. We're going to have to stop China from cheating on trade, build the middle class, build jobs, Wolf. That's what strengthens the Republican Party.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I just want to do a quick \"yes\" or \"no.\" And I'm going to go down the rest of the group and let everybody just tell me \"yes\" or \"no\": Would you pardon Scooter Libby?\n\n\n\n(UNKNOWN): No.\n\n\n\nGILMORE: No. I'm steeped in the law. I wouldn't do that.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: No, not without reading the transcript.\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Not without reading the transcript.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: He's going through an appeal process. We've got to see what happens here.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I think the sentence was way out of line. I mean, the sentence was grossly excessive in a situation in which, at the beginning, the prosecutor knew who the leak was...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: So, yes or no, would you pardon him?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: ... and he knew a crime wasn't committed. I recommended over a thousand pardons to President Reagan when I was associate attorney general. I would see if it fit the criteria for pardon. I'd wait for the appeal.\n\n\n\nI think what the judge did today argues more in favor of a pardon because...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: ... this is excessive punishment.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: When you consider -- I've prosecuted 5,000 cases.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: I'm trying to get a yes or no.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Well, this is a very important issue. This is a very, very important -- a man's life is at stake. And the reality is, this is an incomprehensible situation.\n\n\n\nThey knew who the leak was.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Hey, Wolf, can I explain...\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: And ultimately, there was no underlying crime involved.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nROMNEY: This is one of those situations where I go back to my record as governor. I didn't pardon anybody as governor, because I didn't want to overturn a jury.\n\n\n\nBut in this case, you have a prosecutor who clearly abused prosecutorial discretion by going after somebody when he already knew that the source of the leak was Richard Armitage.\n\n\n\nHe'd been told that. So he went on a political vendetta.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Was that a yes?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: It's worth looking at that. I will study it very closely if I'm lucky enough to be president. And I'd keep that option open.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: Yes. The basic crime here didn't happen. What they were saying was that the identity of an agent... BLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nGovernor?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: ... was revealed, but that agent has to be in the field for that to be a crime. That didn't occur.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Governor?\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: Bill Clinton committed perjury at a grand jury, lost his law license. Scooter Libby got 30 months. To me, it's not fair at all.\n\n\n\nBut I would make sure the appeal was done properly, and then I would examine the record.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Congressman?\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: Yes.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Yes.\n\n\n\nAll right. We heard from all of them.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nWe're ready to take -- go into part two of tonight's debate right now, where voters from New Hampshire will have an opportunity to ask their questions. We have some work to do here on the stage.\n\n\n\nWhile we move some chairs around, move out the podiums, while we do all that, and you'll be able to see it, viewers of WMUR are going to go back to their studios. For the rest of you, I'm going to bring in my colleagues, Larry King and Anderson Cooper, part of the best political team on television, to give us a sense of this debate so far.\n\n\n\nOur debate here will resume in about three minutes.\n\n\n\n(BREAK)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: We're now set for our voters here to ask questions. Our pool of voters here are either registered Republicans or independents, but they're likely -- likely to vote Republican in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.\n\n\n\nWe brought them together with the help from the New Hampshire Political Library and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. CNN producers have interviewed all of them. Working with me in this half of the debate is Jennifer Vaughn from our partner WMUR-TV.\n\n\n\nJennifer, who has the first question?\n\n\n\nJENNIFER VAUGHN, WMUR-TV: Thank you, Wolf.\n\n\n\nAnd good evening to you all tonight. I have Erin Flanagan with me tonight.\n\n\n\nHi, Erin.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Hi, Jennifer.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You live in Bedford, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I do.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You have a question about the war in Iraq, which is something that is deeply personal to you.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: It is. Unfortunately, my beloved little brother, 1st Lieutenant Michael Joseph Cleary, was killed in action in Taji, Iraq, eight days before he was to return home on December 20th of 2005.\n\n\n\nHe was the best of the best and answered the call to serve our country.\n\n\n\nMy family has been devastated by the loss.\n\n\n\nAs a member of an American family who has suffered so greatly at the choices made by the current administration, I desperately would like to know what you as commander in chief would do, both in the halls of the American government, to bring the parties together, as well as on the desert sands of the Middle East to bring this conflict to a point in which we can safely bring our troops home.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Erin, thank you.\n\n\n\nCongressman Hunter, let's begin with you on that.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: OK. Absolutely.\n\n\n\nThe key to leaving -- and, incidentally, thank you for his service.\n\n\n\nAnd I want to let you know, my son...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nI want to let you know that my son Duncan, the day after 9/11, joined the Marine Corps, quit his job, did two tours in Iraq. He's in Afghanistan right now.\n\n\n\nFirst, I want you to know that it's worth it.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nWhat he did was worth it.\n\n\n\nAnd if we can achieve a country in Iraq that will not be an state sponsor of terrorism for the next 5 to 10 to 20 years, that will be a friend, not an enemy, of the United States, and will have a modicum of freedom, that is in the national interest of the United States, just like establishing a free Japan on the other side of the Pacific was in our interest after World War II, just like providing freedom and a protective shield for Salvador in Central America was in our interest.\n\n\n\nSo what I would do, and what we need to do right now, and we are doing, is standing up the Iraqi army. There is 129 battalions of Iraqis that we've trained and equipped.\n\n\n\nWe need to start moving them into the combat zones where they displace the heavy American combat forces. Then we can pull our forces out. We can bring them home or send them wherever Uncle Sam needs them again.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: That's how we leave Iraq the right way.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nSenator Brownback, I'd like you to weigh in.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: If I could.\n\n\n\nAnd thank you for your family's service and what your brother did. That's incredible and an incredible gift that he and your family have given us.\n\n\n\nAnd I think you've identified the right thing. It's not about leaving, and it's not about being defeated. It's about getting the situation to a point that we can turn it over to Iraqis, and then us pull back from the front of the line.\n\n\n\nThat's why I'm putting forward tomorrow a bill, and this would be about a three-state solution in Iraq -- a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shia state -- with Baghdad as the federal city, in a loose, weak, federated system; oil revenues equally divided.\n\n\n\nAnd it's a bipartisan bill. We will have bipartisan support.\n\n\n\nWe've got to pull together here to win over there.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: And we can do this together, but we haven't put yet forward, this administration, a political solution that will be long- term and durable.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: That's what we've got to do.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator McCain, is that a good idea, to divide up Iraq into three separate...\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: It's not divided. It's three states, one country.\n\n\n\nMCCAIN: It's not -- ma'am, I want to tell you thank you for your brother's service and sacrifice to our country. We are proud of you and your endurance, and we're proud of your sacrifice.\n\n\n\nThis war -- I'm going to give you a little straight talk. This war was very badly mismanaged for a long time. And Americans have made great sacrifices, some of which were unnecessary because of this management of the war -- mismanagement of this conflict.\n\n\n\nI believe we have a fine general. I believe we have a strategy which can succeed, so that the sacrifice of your brother would not be in vain, that a whole 20 million or 30 million people would have a chance to live a free life in an open society, and practice their religion, no matter what those differences are.\n\n\n\nAnd I believe that if we fail, it will become a center of terrorism, and we will ask more young Americans to sacrifice, as your brother did.\n\n\n\nThis is long and hard and tough. But I think we can succeed.\n\n\n\nAnd God bless you.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nJennifer, go ahead with your next question.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Cynthia Kiernan is here with us tonight.\n\n\n\nCynthia, you live in Merrimack, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You can go ahead and stand up.\n\n\n\nAnd you brought your husband with you?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes. Michael served in Iraq.\n\n\n\nAnd we have a question regarding the government in Iraq. Everyone's talking about, \"Pull our troops out; pull our troops out.\" Well, considering they've lived under a dictatorship for the last 30 years or so, what are we going to do to make sure they have a government in place before we do pull our troops out and they're able to help themselves? Otherwise, we're just putting them in a position to accept another terrorist leader.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Congressman Paul?\n\n\n\nPAUL: Well, we've had four years to do this and it hasn't worked.\n\n\n\nThe biggest incentive for them to take upon themselves the responsibility is just for us to leave.\n\n\n\nPAUL: We don't need to lose 100 men and women every month, more than a thousand per year.\n\n\n\nAnd so, if you want it done, you want them to take over, you've got to give them an incentive.\n\n\n\nSo I think we should immediately stop patrolling the streets. That's a policeman's job. It's not the work of the Army. We're not fighting a military battle. We're in a different type of warfare right now.\n\n\n\nSo the sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can make sure that no more Americans will die.\n\n\n\nWe have a lot of goodness in this country. And we should promote it, but never through the barrel of a gun. We should do it by setting good standards, motivating people and have them want to emulate us.\n\n\n\nBut you can't enforce our goodness, like the necons preach, with an armed force. It doesn't work.\n\n\n\nWoodrow Wilson was telling us about that, in promoting democracy a long time ago.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nPAUL: It doesn't work and we have to admit it.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nLet me bring Mayor Giuliani in.\n\n\n\nI don't know if you consider yourself a neocon, but go ahead and respond to what Congressman Paul said.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: Michael, thank you very much for serving us, and thank your family for their tremendous sacrifice.\n\n\n\nI'd like to put it in a slightly different context. I believe that your service for us and your brother's sacrifice is one of the reasons we're safe now in the United States.\n\n\n\nI believe that this terrorist war began way back in the 1970s. They attacked us in 1993 in New York. They attacked us again in 2001 in a horrible way.\n\n\n\nAnd I believe that what we're doing in Iraq, if we can get it right, is going to help reduce the risk for this country. And if we get it wrong, this is going to be much, much worse for us.\n\n\n\nAnd part of what we have to do and we haven't done right is take on that responsibility of nation-building. We created that responsibility for ourselves when we overthrew Saddam Hussein, which we did very effectively. It was one of the greatest military actions in American history, overthrowing Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n\nBut we didn't accomplish the second step. People can only embrace democracy when they have an orderly existence. And we have to help provide that. We didn't want that role, but it is our role.\n\n\n\nAnd we have to train our military to do it.\n\n\n\nWe should probably have an IraqStat program, in which we measure how many people are going to school, how many factories are open, how many people are going back to work.\n\n\n\nWe had to get into the nitty-gritty of putting an orderly society together in Iraq. It is not too late to do it.\n\n\n\nAnd I'd just like to ask, I'd just like to ask one question I didn't get to ask before, when you said, if General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things aren't going well, what are we going to do?\n\n\n\nBut suppose General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things are going pretty well. Are we going to report that with the same amount of attention that we would report the negative news?\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Jennifer, go ahead.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Kysa Crusco is here with us tonight.\n\n\n\nHi, Kysa.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Hi.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire. You are an attorney.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I am.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: OK. What's your question tonight?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: My question is whether you believe that a conservative platform can also include a conservationist agenda. And, if so, how?\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Governor Gilmore?\n\n\n\nGILMORE: The question was whether or not a conservative agenda can also have a conservation agenda. And I think that it can.\n\n\n\nCertainly, when I was governor of the state of Virginia, we worked very hard in order to make Virginia a beautiful place and a place where we could in fact be welcoming to people, and that it would be a nice community for people to visit.\n\n\n\nBut at the end of the day, this is going to come down to the question of whether or not conservatism can match up with energy independence, which is a national security issue and it is a fundamental part of conservatism.\n\n\n\nConservatism means empowering people. It means cutting taxes and controlling government spending. It also means national security. And national security means a lot of different elements right at this time. And we're discussing some of them tonight.\n\n\n\nAnd I can assure the people who are families here tonight, their young people, young men and women who are on the battle lines, and people who are committing their lives, they are in fact serving the national interests of this country in a time of major crisis.\n\n\n\nThe other two issues, however, would also go to the issue of the immigration issue, which I want to come back to at some point, but also energy independence.\n\n\n\nAnd energy independence also can serve the interests of conservation...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nGILMORE: ... particularly if we use nuclear power and other clean forms of energy so that we can in fact make this a clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor.\n\n\n\nCongressman Tancredo, do you believe true conservatives should be doing more to protect the environment?\n\n\n\nTANCREDO: Yes.\n\n\n\nI think that that's absolutely imperative, and I think so because, frankly, you've got a conservative model to pick from. I mean, you know, Teddy Roosevelt, after all, put this stamp on that -- the whole issue of conserving the environment, creating the national parks system.\n\n\n\nThere's nothing anti-conservative about doing anything like that.\n\n\n\nAnd you know what else you can do in order to foster that? You do it through conservative principles. You make it profitable for people to do exactly that, to put -- to make conservation an issue that hits people in the pocketbook, or they can profit by getting involved in conservation.\n\n\n\nThat's one way the free market really works perfectly. We've seen it happen all over the world. We can see and we will put conservation to work -- conservation practices to work in the United States through conservative principles. We have a lock on that.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nJennifer, go ahead.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Good evening, sir. You are Doug Hall.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: I understand that you're the town moderator for Chichester, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I am.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: What's your question tonight?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I know a business owner in northern New Hampshire who was on vacation in Spain last year for about three weeks. While he was there, he had to buy refills for prescription drugs, brand name drugs, and he discovered in buying those drugs that he could buy his refills there for $600 less than he could buy them here in New Hampshire. So since then, he said he is going to take a trip over to Spain and get his vacation paid for to buy his drugs.\n\n\n\nMy question to you is, why is this? And if you are elected president, is there anything you would do to address it?\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Mayor Giuliani?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: What I would do is change the whole model that we have for health insurance in this country.\n\n\n\nThe problem with our health insurance is, it's government and employer-dominated. People don't make individual choices. It's your health. You should own your health insurance.\n\n\n\nWe should be giving you a major tax deduction, $15,000 for a family, so you can buy your own health insurance. If you buy health insurance for $8,000 or $9,000, you'll save $5,000 or $6,000 in tax- free money.\n\n\n\nThen we should have a health savings account, in which you can put some money aside to pay for your ordinary medical expenses.\n\n\n\nHealth insurance should become like homeowners insurance or like car insurance. You don't cover everything on your homeowners policy. If you have a slight accident in your house, if you need to refill your oil with your car, you don't cover that with insurance. But that is covered in many of the insurance policies, because they're government-dominated and they're employer-dominated.\n\n\n\nWhat the Democrats suggested on this stage two nights ago was socialized medicine. There was a man in California who said to me, \"When we make health insurance free, just wait and see how expensive it will become.\"\n\n\n\nAnd the reality is that we need a free market. We need 100 million Americans making different decisions. It will bring down the cost of health insurance. It will bring down the cost of prescription medicines.\n\n\n\nFree-market principles are the only things that reduce costs and improve quality. Socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the United States. BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCongressman Hunter, you live on the border, San Diego, not far from Mexico. A lot of Americans go to Mexico to buy cheaper prescription drugs. A lot of Americans in this part of the country go to Canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs.\n\n\n\nWhat should we here in the United States be doing to bring down the price of prescription drugs?\n\n\n\nHUNTER: And, Wolf, the fabulous Grampy, my father-in-law, who lives with us, is one of those people that trots down and goes through the border at Yuma and does that. So lots of Americans do that.\n\n\n\nBut here's what happens. Eighty percent of the new drugs and new inventions that save our lives, that help preserve the lives of the relatives of everyone who's in this particular room right now, 80 percent of those inventions are made in the United States because we have free enterprise, where people can go out, invest. And maybe they drill three dry holes in trying to produce a good drug that will save somebody's lives. Then maybe they hit the jackpot and they produce something that will save people and help their health.\n\n\n\nThey then recover their money in the United States. And what they have left over, in terms of market, they put into the Third World. But Third World countries like Mexico could never provide the amount of money that it takes to make those inventions. Otherwise, they would.\n\n\n\nHere's what we have to do: We need to be able to buy our health care insurance across state lines, Wolf. Right now the same single policy that can be purchased in Long Beach for $73 costs $334 in New Jersey.\n\n\n\nThe states lock up the insurance industry. They won't let Americans buy across state lines, just like they do everything else. If we're able to do that...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHUNTER: ... we're going to bring down the cost of health insurance.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nJennifer, let's go back to another question.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Also on the topic of health care tonight, this is a question from our wmur.gather.com blogger, who is Joshua Williamson.\n\n\n\nJoshua asks, \"Millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the current state of our health-care system, and U.S. employers are at a disadvantage due to the high cost of health insurance. What would you do to fix the health-care system? And would you support implementing a single-payer system, in which the government acts as the insurer in order to save enough money to cover the millions of uninsured and to lower premiums for the rest of the U.S. population?\"\n\n\n\nGovernor Thompson, let's have you weigh in on that.\n\n\n\nTHOMPSON: You know, I've been here for two debates. We never had one question on health care. Thank that person for talking about health care.\n\n\n\nNumber one, we spend $2 trillion on health care. That's 16 percent of the gross national product. Ninety-three percent of the cost of health care goes into waiting until after you become sick. Only 7 percent of the money is used to keep you well in the first place.\n\n\n\nWe got to completely transform the health care system, make it a wellness system and make it a prevention system.\n\n\n\nSecondly, we have 125 million Americans that have one or more chronic illnesses. In order to change this, we have to educate the American people about tobacco, about diabetes, about cardiovascular and about obesity.\n\n\n\nYou do that, you'll be able to change health care.\n\n\n\nThe third thing, 25 percent of Americans use two-thirds of the cost of health care. If you manage those diseases, you can reduce that down to 50 percent and save lots of money.\n\n\n\nFourth, information technology, electronic medical record, a patient bill of rights and be able to have e-prescribing. And if you do that, you're going to be able to save billions of dollars.\n\n\n\nIf you just go paperless, ladies and gentlemen, you will save 10 percent of the cost of health care.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor, very much.\n\n\n\nGovernor Romney, you worked with the Democrats in the state legislature in your home state, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. You worked with Ted Kennedy to come up with a program that provides some -- mandates, in effect, the individual health insurance coverage.\n\n\n\nSome conservatives say this is simply big government, more liberal involvement in people's lives.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to those conservatives who are critical of the way you handled this issue in Massachusetts?\n\n\n\nROMNEY: Well, I want to talk to the people, not just to those conservatives who are critical. And the people of this country recognize they've got some real concerns in health care. And I learned after I was governor a short bit of time -- I talked to people and they say, \"If I lose my job, I'm going to lose my insurance. And my insurance premiums are getting higher and higher and higher.\"\n\n\n\nAnd I talked to small-business people, and they said, \"I can't afford the policies anymore.\"\n\n\n\nAnd we said, \"You know, we've got to find a way to get everybody insured. And the last thing we want is to have the government take over health care, because anything they take over gets worse, not better.\n\n\n\n\"We're going to turn to Washington, because Washington makes a mess. Washington is all talk.\n\n\n\nAnd we said, \"We need to find a way to get everybody in our state insured with private insurance.\"\n\n\n\nThe half a million who didn't have insurance, all the people worried that if they lost their job, they'd lose insurance, we said, \"We've got to find a way to get them insured without raising taxes, without a government takeover.\"\n\n\n\nAnd that's what we did. It relies on personal responsibility.\n\n\n\nThis is a big issue for this country. Every Democrat up there is talking about a form of socialized medicine, government takeover, massive tax increase.\n\n\n\nWe have to stand up and not just talk about it. I'm the guy who actually tackled this issue. We get all of our citizens insured. We get people that were uninsured with private health insurance.\n\n\n\nWe have to stand up and say, \"The market works. Personal responsibility works.\"\n\n\n\nWe're going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford, that's theirs, that's portable. They never have to worry about losing it. That's the answer.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nJennifer, go ahead.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Thank you, Wolf.\n\n\n\nNext question comes from you, sir. Your name is Max Latona.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes, it is.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire. What do you do for a living, sir?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: I teach philosophy here at Saint Anselm College.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: And what's your question tonight?\n\n\n\nQUESTION: My question is a simple one: In your opinion, what is the most pressing moral issue facing this country today? And, if you're elected president, how would you address that issue?\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Governor Huckabee, you are an ordained minister. What is the most pressing moral issue in this country?\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: Well, it looks like I'm getting all the moral questions tonight, and I guess that's a good thing.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nThat's better than getting the immoral questions. So I'm happy to get those.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nHUCKABEE: I really believe that, if you define it a moral issue, it is our respect, our sanctity and our understanding of the value of every single human life.\n\n\n\nBecause that is what makes America a unique place on this planet: We value every life of an individual as if it represents the life of us all.\n\n\n\nMany of us who are pro-life, quite frankly, I think, have made the mistake of giving people the impression that pro-life means we care intensely about people as long as that child is in the womb. But beyond the gestation period, we've not demonstrated as demonstrably as we should that we respect life at all levels, not just during pregnancy.\n\n\n\nWe shouldn't allow a child to live under a bridge or in the backseat of a car. We shouldn't be satisfied that elderly people are being abused and neglected in nursing homes. It should never be acceptable to us that people are treated as expendable -- any people.\n\n\n\nBut the unique part of our country is that we elevate and we celebrate human life. And if you look at us with a contrast to the Islamic jihadists, who would strap a bomb to the belly of their own child, march him into a crowded room, set the detonator and kill innocent people, they celebrate death; we celebrate life.\n\n\n\nIt's the fundamental thing that makes us unique, and it keeps us free. I pray we never, ever abandon that basic principle.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, what is the most pressing moral issue in America today?\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: I think the governor is correct. I would put it in maybe a slightly different way. We have great gifts in this country that come to us from God. We have a country in which we have freedom of religion, freedom of press, freedom for the individual, the right to elect our own officials. And the reality is that in some of the world, much of the world, that doesn't exist.\n\n\n\nAnd I think the challenge for our generation is going to be, are we able to share those gifts in an appropriate way with the rest of the world?\n\n\n\nIf we can bring along the Middle East, if we can bring along those countries that are presently our enemies, and get them to see the values of these ideals, if we have the moral strength to be able to explain it to them in the way Ronald Reagan was able to do with communism, then we can end up having the peace that we want.\n\n\n\nAnd we should not -- we should never become pessimistic about this. Remember, this is the country that was at war with Vietnam just a short while ago. We're friends now.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: All right.\n\n\n\nGIULIANI: This was a country that was at war with Japan, Italy and Germany a generation ago. They're some of our best friends today.\n\n\n\nWe have great resources in this country. And watching the strength of America when we believe in the essential ideals that we have -- they're not just American ideals; they come from God. And I think it's our moral obligation to find the right way to share that with the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Mayor.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCongressman Paul, what is the most pressing moral issue in the United States right now?\n\n\n\nPAUL: I think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote preemptive war. I do not believe that's part of the American tradition.\n\n\n\nWe, in the past, have always declared war in defense of our liberties or go to aid somebody. But now we have accepted the principle of preemptive war. We have rejected the just war theory of Christianity.\n\n\n\nAnd now, tonight, we hear that we're not even willing to remove from the table a preemptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security.\n\n\n\nI mean, we have to come to our senses about this issue of war and preemption and go back to traditions and our Constitution and defend our liberties and defend our rights, but not to think that we can change the world by force of arms and to start wars.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Congressman.\n\n\n\nSenator Brownback really wants to weigh in, as well.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: Thank you.\n\n\n\nAnd thank you for the question from a philosopher.\n\n\n\nI think it's the life issue clearly, and I'm pro-life and I'm whole life.\n\n\n\nAnd one of the things I'm the most -- the proudest about our party about is that we've stood for life. We've been a party that has stood for a culture of life. And it was in our platform in 1980, and it continues today.\n\n\n\nAnd with that respect -- and I have respect for my other colleagues -- that's why I don't think we can nominate somebody that's not pro-life in this party, because it is at our core.\n\n\n\nWe believe that every life is beautiful, is sacred, is a child of a loving God from natural -- from conception to natural death.\n\n\n\nAnd that applies not only here and in the womb, it applies to somebody that's in poverty, it applies to the child in Darfur.\n\n\n\nAnd that philosophy, being pro-life and whole life, is something I think can really help move us forward as a country and as a party.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Senator, if Rudy Giuliani got the Republican presidential nomination, would you be able to support him?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: That question came up at the first debate, and I stated that this is something that we as a party have struggled with. I have great respect for the mayor. I don't think we're going to nominate somebody that's not pro-life.\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Would you be able to support him?\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: I can support and will support the nominee of our party. But our party has stood on principles. It's a party of principles. It's not a party of personalities. We lose when we walk away from our principles.\n\n\n\nThat's when we have trouble. And that's the country wants us to do...\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Senator.\n\n\n\nBROWNBACK: ... is to stand for principles.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBLITZER: Jennifer, go ahead.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: Next question tonight from Neil Capano.\n\n\n\nNeil, you are an airline agent.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes, I am.\n\n\n\nVAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nYou have a question tonight for Governor Romney.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: Yes, I do.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank all of you for joining us tonight in beautiful Manchester, New Hampshire. However, my question is for Governor Romney exclusively.\n\n\n\nYou've been accused of -- you've been accused of flip-flopping on immigration.\n\n\n\nJust earlier tonight you indicated "

    "text": "With Americans demanding a new way forward in Washington, House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) uses the Weekly Republican Address to outline solutions for ending economic uncertainty, stopping government\u2019s spending binge, and changing the way Congress does business. In the address, Boehner notes that this is a new approach that hasn\u2019t been tried in Washington \u2013 by either party \u2013 and it is at the core of the Pledge to America, a governing agenda Republicans built by listening to the people.\n\n\n\nLeader Boehner recorded the weekly address earlier this week from Ohio, where he ran a small business and saw first-hand how Washington can make it harder for employers and entrepreneurs to meet a payroll and create jobs. Following is a transcript of Boehner\u2019s remarks. Audio of the Weekly Republican Address is available now here. The video will be available here for viewing and here for downloading.\n\n\n\n\u201cHello. I\u2019m John Boehner.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore I served in Congress, I ran a small business here in Ohio, and I saw first-hand how politicians in Washington can make it harder for small employers to meet a payroll and create jobs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the final days of the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama promised to \u2018change this country and change the world.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know about the world, but here at home, Americans haven\u2019t experienced the change President Obama promised. One in ten of our fellow citizens is out of work. Our national debt has grown by $3 trillion Trust in government has fallen to an all-time low.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese problems didn\u2019t start under President Obama. But instead of fixing them, his policies have made them worse. A \u2018stimulus\u2019 spending spree that created jobs in China and El Salvador, while millions of Americans lost their jobs here. A job-killing national energy tax. A government takeover of health care.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll these things have combined to create massive uncertainty for small businesses, the engine of job creation in America, while our children face a future clouded by debt.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmericans are demanding a new way forward in Washington \u2013 an approach that neither party has tried.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it; making government smaller and more accountable; and helping small businesses get back to creating jobs again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Republicans are offering with our Pledge to America, a governing agenda built by listening to the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cA generation of fiscal recklessness in Washington has pushed us to the brink. Just to stay afloat, we\u2019re now borrowing 41 cents of every dollars we spend from our kids and grandkids.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis spending spree threatens our children\u2019s future. It\u2019s also hurting our economy. Americans know it has to stop, and our Pledge to America puts forth a plan to do just that. We\u2019re ready to cut spending to pre-\u2018stimulus,\u2019 pre-bailout levels, saving taxpayers $100 billion almost immediately. And we\u2019re ready to put in place strict budget caps that limit spending from here on out, to ensure that Washington is no longer on this spending binge.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to stop the coming tax hike. We can\u2019t balance the budget without cutting spending and achieving real economic growth \u2013 and we won\u2019t have real economic growth if we raise taxes on small businesses and families.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a third thing we need to do to help our economy, and that\u2019s change Congress itself. The American people are in charge of this country, and they deserve a Congress that acts like it. Americans should have three days to read all bills before Congress votes on them \u2013 something they didn\u2019t get when the \u2018stimulus\u2019 was rushed into law. We should put an end to so-called \u2018comprehensive\u2019 bills that make it easy to hide wasteful spending projects and job-killing policies. Bills should be written by legislators in committee in plain public view \u2013 not written in the Speaker\u2019s office, behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n\u201cAcross our nation, Americans are looking at President Obama\u2019s policies and asking \u2013 \u2018where are the jobs?\u2019 To help our economy get back on track, we have to stop all of the coming tax hikes and cut spending \u2013 and to cut spending, we need to change Congress itself.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a new way forward that hasn\u2019t been tried in Washington yet. It\u2019s a break from the direction in which President Obama has taken our country. And frankly, it\u2019s also a break from the direction in which Republicans were headed when Americans last entrusted us with the reins of government. The American people are in charge, and they deserve nothing less.\n\n\n\n\u201cTogether, we can do these things. And in doing so, we can begin the drive for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable government that honors our Constitution and respects the will of the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese ideas are at the core of our Pledge to America.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried it President Obama\u2019s way. We\u2019ve tried it Washington\u2019s way. It hasn\u2019t worked. It\u2019s time to put the people back in charge.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for your time and may God bless the United States of America.\""

    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nAdvanced Imaging Technology\n\nQ. What is advanced imaging technology?\n\nA. Advanced imaging technology safely screens passengers for both metallic and non-metallic threats, including weapons and explosives, which may be concealed under a passengers\u2019 clothing without physical contact to keep the traveling public secure.\n\nQ. Does imaging technology work?\n\nA. Yes. Imaging technology is a highly effective security tool, which can detect both metallic and non-metallic items that may pose a threat to aviation security. AIT is a proven technology and TSA is highly confident in its detection capability.\n\nQ. Is imaging technology optional?\n\nA. Yes, imaging technology screening is optional for all passengers. Passengers who do not wish to receive imagining technology screening will receive alternative screening, including a physical pat-down.\n\nQ. Is imaging technology safe?\n\nA. Advanced imaging technology is safe and meets national health and safety standards. Backscatter technology was evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). For comparison, a single scan using backscatter technology produces exposure equivalent to two minutes of flying on an airplane, and the energy projected by millimeter wave technology is thousands of times less than a cell phone transmission.\n\nQ. What has TSA done to protect my privacy?\n\nA. TSA has implemented strict measures to protect passenger privacy, which is ensured through the anonymity of the image. A remotely located officer views the image and does not see the passenger, and the officer assisting the passenger cannot view the image. The image cannot be stored, transmitted or printed, and is deleted immediately once viewed. Additionally, there is a privacy algorithm applied to blur the image.\n\nQ. How does the imaging technology screening process work?\n\nA. Each passenger will be asked to take everything out of their pockets (including non-metallic items) and walk into the imaging portal. Once inside, they will be asked to stand in a position and remain still for a few seconds while the technology creates an image of the passenger in real time. A remotely located officer views the image. After review and resolution of any anomalies, the image is immediately deleted. The passenger will then be free to exit the opposite side of the portal and collect belongings. The entire process takes a matter of seconds, compared to a 2-4 minute pat-down.\n\nQ. How does backscatter imaging technology work?\n\nA. Backscatter technology projects an ionizing X-ray beam over the body surface at high speed. The reflection, or \u201cbackscatter,\u201d of the beam is detected, digitized and displayed on a monitor. Each full body scan produces less than 10 microREM of emission, the equivalent to the exposure each person receives in about 2 minutes of airplane flight at altitude. It produces an image that resembles a chalk-etching, and has a privacy filter applied to the entire body.\n\nQ. How does millimeter wave imaging technology work?\n\nA. Millimeter wave technology bounces harmless electromagnetic waves off of the human body to create a black and white image. It is safe, and the energy emitted by millimeter wave technology is thousands of times less than what is permitted for a cell phone. Millimeter wave technology has a privacy filter that blurs facial features.\n\n\n\nQ. Where are imaging technology machines located?\n\nA. Currently, there are 127 advanced imaging technology machines located at 36 airports nationwide. Airports that have the technology include the following.\n\nAlbuquerque International Sunport Airport\n\nBaltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport\n\nBoston Logan International Airport\n\nCharlotte Douglas International Airport\n\nChicago O'Hare International Airport\n\nCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport\n\nCorpus Christi International Airport\n\nDenver International Airport\n\nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport\n\nDetroit Metro Airport\n\nEl Paso International Airport\n\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport\n\nFort Wayne International Airport\n\nHarlingen/Valley International Airport\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport\n\nIndianapolis International Airport\n\nJacksonville International Airport\n\nKansas City International Airport\n\nLos Angeles International Airport\n\nMcAllen Miller Airport\n\nMcCarran International Airport\n\nMiami International Airport\n\nSan Jose International Airprot\n\nOmaha Eppley Airfield Airport\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport\n\nPort Columbus International Airport\n\nRaleigh-Durham International Airport\n\nRichmond International Airport\n\nRonald Reagan Washington National Airport\n\nSalt Lake City International Airport\n\nSan Francisco International Airport\n\nTampa International Airport\n\nTulsa International Airport\n\nBoise Airport\n\nBrownsville/South Padre Island International Airport\n\nBuffalo Niagara International Airport\n\nGulfport-Biloxi International Airport\n\nHouston William P. Hobby Airport\n\nLa Guardia International Airport\n\nLaredo International Airport\n\nLuis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport\n\nOakland International Airport\n\nOrlando International Airport\n\nPittsburgh International Airport\n\nReno-Tahoe International Airport\n\nSan Diego International Airport\n\nSpokane International Airport\n\nT. F. Green International Airport\n\nQ. Where else is advanced imaging technology used?\n\nA. Domestic locations:\n\nColorado Springs Court House (CO\n\n) Cook County Court House (IL)\n\nDepartment of Corrections facility (PA)\n\nDouglas County Colorado Justice Center\n\nMontana State Prison\n\nUtah State Correctional Facility\n\nInternational locations:Advanced imaging technology is used in hundreds of locations around the world in aviation and mass transit environments, including Canada, France, the Netherlands, Nigeria and the United Kingdom.\n\nIf you need additional information, please e-mail the TSA Contact Center at TSA-ContactCenter@dhs.gov."

    "text": "March 13, 2011 \u0097 -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voice-over): This week, \"Target Libya.\" Missile strikes begin.\n\nOBAMA: Our consensus was strong, and our resolve is clear. The people of Libya must be protected.\n\nAMANPOUR: Another war front opens for the United States. The world unleashes all necessary measures to stop Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. His son, Saif, speaks to \"This Week\" in a worldwide exclusive. What next for Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan people, for the United States military? How does it end?\n\nThen, disaster in the Pacific. Nuclear nightmare scenario in Japan. How prepared is the United States? Could it happen here? Libya and Japan, two crises with major consequences for the United States.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, D.C., \"This Week\" with Christiane Amanpour, \"Target Libya,\" starts right now.\n\nAMANPOUR: As we begin our broadcast, the United States is at war in a third Muslim country, Libya. We'll take you there live in just a moment. ABC's team of correspondents is covering every angle of this story. I will have an exclusive interview with Moammar Gadhafi's son and close adviser, Saif al-Islam. And I'll be joined here in the studio by Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to discuss what's being called Operation Odyssey Dawn.\n\nBut first, the latest headlines in this fast-moving story. A defiant Moammar Gadhafi is promising a long war, one day after the United States and a broad international coalition launched military strikes on his country. British and American ships and submarines fired 112 cruise missiles at more than 20 targets on the coast.\n\nAmerican B-2 bombers took out a Libyan airfield, all part of the largest Western military intervention in the Arab world since the start of the Iraq war. The show of force is designed to impose a no- fly zone to prevent the Libyan strongman from firing on his own people.\n\nSunday, Tripoli shook with the sound of explosions and anti- aircraft fire. Libyan state television reported that 48 people had been killed.\n\nBut today, in a phone call to state television, Gadhafi said Libyans stand ready to fight what he calls \"crusaders.\" This is a fight, he says, that he will win.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nM. GADHAFI (through translator): You are not capable of a prolonged -- for a prolonged war in Libya. We consider ourselves ready for a long war. Be aware of that. We're not retreating anywhere, because this is our land. This is where we're staying. Then you're going to return defeated.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Joining me on the line from Tripoli in Libya, Saif al- Islam, Colonel Gadhafi's second son and close adviser.\n\nSaif, thank you for joining me. Can you tell me right now, where are you? And what is happening there right now?\n\nGADHAFI: You know, we are in Tripoli, as you know. But yesterday, we were surprised that -- you know, the Americans and the British and the French attacked Libya, attacked five cities, terrorized people, and (inaudible) children, women were so afraid yesterday, heavy bombing everywhere. So it was a big surprise that, finally, President Obama -- we thought he's a good man and friend of Arab world -- is bombing Libya.\n\nAMANPOUR: Saif, President Obama very explicitly gave your father an ultimatum and said cease fire, stop, and this won't happen. He then had to say that the attacks continue and the United States cannot sit idly by while a leader says that there will be no mercy. Why did your father continue the attacks in Benghazi? Why didn't he have a cease fire?\n\nGADHAFI: First of all, our people went to Benghazi to liberate Benghazi from the gangsters and the armed militia. So if you -- if the Americans want to -- want to help the Libyan people in Benghazi, so go to Benghazi and liberate Benghazi from the militia and the terrorists. So do it.\n\nAMANPOUR: My question, though, is, there is now missile strikes and an air attack against Libya. Will Colonel Gadhafi step down? Will he step aside?\n\nGADHAFI: Step aside why? I mean, to step -- again, there's a big misunderstanding. The whole country is united against the armed militia and the terrorists. You asked -- simply, the Americans and other Western countries, you are supporting the terrorists and the armed militia. That's it.\n\nAMANPOUR: Saif, will there be Libyan retaliation against, let's say, commercial flights around the Mediterranean or other targets?\n\nGADHAFI: No, this is not our target. Our target is how to help our people in Libya, especially in Benghazi. Believe me, they are living a nightmare, a nightmare, really, a nightmare. They have no freedom, nothing under the rule of the armed militia.\n\nSo we urge the Americans either to go there themselves and help our people there or let the Libyan people help their brothers in Benghazi. But believe me, one day, you wake up and you will find out that you were supporting the wrong people. And you are being a big mistake with supporting those people. It's like the WMD in Iraq. It's another story.\n\nAMANPOUR: Saif al-Islam, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us from Tripoli.\n\nGADHAFI: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: So that's the view from the Gadhafis in Tripoli. Let's go to eastern Libya, the rebel stronghold where ABC's Alexander Marquardt joins us live.\n\nSo what is the mood there where you are?\n\nMARQUARDT: Good morning, Christiane. We are in Tubruq, in eastern Libya, where an opposition spokesman told us this morning that morale is sky high. They've been pleading for military intervention for weeks. They now feel that there's a level playing field, that the rebels will be able to push the Gadhafi forces out of the east, away from cities like Ajdabiya and Benghazi that have seen heavy fighting over the last few days. Eventually, they want to make their way to Tripoli, where they plan to oust Gadhafi.\n\nWe spoke with people on the streets. They're understandably very happy, thanking the coalition for what they've done, specifically France and the U.K., for introducing the resolution at the U.N. They believe that this intervention will lead to victory and eventually to a free Libya.\n\nBut with this change in tide comes a period of insurgency. The opposition spokesman said that this is the scary part, because of how illogical Gadhafi is and because of -- because of what he calls his thirst for blood.\n\nChristiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: Alex, thanks.\n\nAnd now let's go to the capital Tripoli, again. That could soon be ground zero in this conflict. Moammar Gadhafi is there, and so is the BBC's Allan Little, who joins us now live.\n\nSo, Allan, you heard from the Gadhafis. You heard the mood in Benghazi. What do you think is the next move in Tripoli? And how are they portraying it there?\n\nLITTLE: Well, fighting talk from Colonel Gadhafi, as from his son, Saif, largely for domestic consumption. It's not hard to go around the city and find people willing to echo those sentiments, diehard devotees of Colonel Gadhafi saying that -- people saying they're willing to die along with him if it comes to that.\n\nThere's no doubting the sincerity of those people, I think, and the passion with which they speak. Their devotion then seems to get more intense the more isolated he becomes from the world. The question is, how representative is that voice? No other voice can make itself heard here in the prevailing atmosphere in which patriotism for Libya is fused with devotion to the person of Gadhafi himself.\n\nWhat are those hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people who do not take part in those demonstrations of devotion, really feel and think in the silence of their own heads? What is the real sentiment of Tripoli? That is simply impossible in this atmosphere to gauge.\n\nAMANPOUR: Allan, thank you so much.\n\nAnd, of course, the leaders of Britain, France, and President Obama is keeping a close tab on the unfolding situation. ABC's Jake Tapper is live at the White House.\n\nAnd, Jake, what from the White House is the end game here? What's the perspective from there?\n\nTAPPER: Good morning, Christiane. President Obama is in Brazil. But you talked on a very, very difficult question for the White House, because it's been the position of President Obama that there should be regime change in Libya, since March 3rd, when Obama said that Gadhafi has to go.\n\nBut that is not the goal of this military operation. The goal of this military operation officially is to impose a no-fly zone and to protect civilians. Gadhafi stepping down is not part of it.\n\nSo what I would expect is that you will see more efforts internationally to arm the Libyan rebels so that they will take into their own hands the goal of toppling Gadhafi. But that is not officially the goal of this military operation, so it's a delicate dance for President Obama as he attempts to make this military operation even more international than previous U.S. military operations.\n\nAs you know, as we've talked about, there's been a huge effort by the White House to make this seem as though the United States is not playing a leading role, even though, of course, we have 11 ships in the Mediterranean, five of which were firing Tomahawk missiles. There, of course, are other nations participating in the military operation, France, the U.K., and others coming in the coming days, but right now, the U.S. is taking a major leadership role, although the Obama administration wants to make this seem as though it is the world against Gadhafi, not Obama and the U.S. against Gadhafi, Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: Jake, just very quickly, do you think the U.S. will arm the rebels?\n\nTAPPER: I think it's a distinct possibility that the U.S. will be part of an international effort to do so. I would doubt very much that the U.S. would do so on its own.\n\nAMANPOUR: Jake, all right.\n\nAnd let's go now to Martha Raddatz. The U.S. is pledging, as Jake said, to step back to a support role after the initial phase. Martha, you're there. You're covering the military. Is that happening? Do you think it's realistic to go into a support role? It's obviously very unusual in these kinds of military interventions. RADDATZ: It's certainly unusual for the U.S. And right now, a U.S. general is in charge of the operation, General Carter Ham. And you have an admiral, Admiral Scott -- or Sam Locklear, who is on a ship. And he is the tactical commander, meaning he is coordinating all of these air strikes.\n\nBut in a few days, the hope is, the U.S. hopes that General Carter Ham can turn over his responsibility to one of the coalition members. That is the plan right now. I don't think they know who that will be.\n\nBut in this initial phase, the U.S. does have unique capabilities, as the president keeps saying. You had stealth bombers going in there. You had the B-2 bombers going in there. You had these Tomahawk missiles on the ships. So the U.S. felt it had to take the lead role in this phase.\n\nAnd this phase is, of course, to wipe out Gadhafi's air defenses. The next phase will be the no-fly zone. I do think the U.S. will be involved in that somewhat and will have fighters involved in that, but the bulk of the no-fly zone will be flown by British pilots, French pilots, and other allies.\n\nAMANPOUR: Martha, thank you so much.\n\nAnd joining me next, Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And we'll put that to him. I'll ask him how the missions will work, when it will end, and whether it can succeed at all if Moammar Gadhafi remains in power.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: Welcome back.\n\nThough his son sounded subdued, Moammar Gadhafi himself was sounding undaunted this morning. He says his supporters are armed and prepared to fight, and he's pledging that this will be, quote, \"a long war.\"\n\nJoining me now, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen.\n\nThank you for joining us.\n\nMULLEN: Good morning.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is the United States leading this? Or is it in a supporting role?\n\nMULLEN: Well, actually, the French were the first ones in yesterday, in terms of starting to establish the no-fly zone. The United States is taking the lead in terms of the coalition. General Carter Ham, U.S. commander of U.S. AFRICOM, is actually the commander right now. And we look to, in the next few days, transition that to a coalition leadership.\n\nAMANPOUR: So the U.S. will pull back?\n\nMULLEN: The U.S. will essentially take a supporting role, providing unique capabilities, certainly in terms of things like jamming, things like...\n\nAMANPOUR: But not bombing and flying over?\n\nMULLEN: No -- well, certainly, the -- we'll be in transition. I mean, effectively, Christiane, what's happened in the last 24 hours is the no-fly zone has been put -- has essentially started to have its effects. We've got aircraft over Benghazi right now. We have that for 24/7. He hasn't flown any aircraft in the last two days. So the initial part of the operation and the idea of getting a no-fly zone in place is...\n\nAMANPOUR: Is successful?\n\nMULLEN: Well, it has been successful so far.\n\nAMANPOUR: So will it be a long war, as Colonel Gadhafi pledges?\n\nMULLEN: Well, we're very focused on the limited objectives that the president has given us and actually the international coalition has given us, in terms of providing the no-fly zone so that he cannot attack his own people, to avoid any kind of humanitarian massacre, if you will, and to provide for the humanitarian corridors, humanitarian support of the Libyan people.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you say a limited objective, but we've heard from the president, we've heard from the secretary of state, Gadhafi has to go. Is that the military objective?\n\nMULLEN: Well, the military objective is -- is as I just described it, in terms of -- the mission is very clear right now. It's to focus on getting this no-fly zone in place and to support the U.N. objectives of no humanitarian crisis and humanitarian support, protecting Libyan civilians.\n\nAMANPOUR: So it's possible that we could have, like Iraq, a 12- year no-fly zone with the strongman still in place?\n\nMULLEN: Well, again, I think circumstances will drive where this goes in the future. I wouldn't speculate in terms of length at this particular point in time. It's had a pretty significant effect very early in terms of our ability to address his forces -- to attack his forces on the ground, which we did yesterday outside Benghazi, and get the no-fly zone stood up.\n\nAMANPOUR: What about other countries, such as Bahrain, such as Yemen? If the United States military is attacking to protect civilians in Libya, why not in Bahrain and Yemen?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think, first of all, just back to Libya, a very important part of this has been the Arab League vote to establish a no-fly zone and the -- the partners -- the coalition partners that are coming into play with respect to Libya.\n\nAMANPOUR: Correct. But what's the logic?\n\nMULLEN: In terms of...\n\nAMANPOUR: Of other people being -- civilians being killed in other countries where the U.S. has an interest?\n\nMULLEN: Well, I think -- I think we have to -- to be very careful to treat every country differently. Certainly, there's a tremendous change going on right now throughout the Middle East, including in Bahrain. And Bahrain is a much different -- in a much different situation than Libya.\n\nWe haven't had a relationship with Libya for a long, long time. The Bahrainis and that country has been a critical ally for decades. So we're working very hard to support a peaceful resolution there, as tragic as it has been, and we certainly decry the violence which has occurred in Bahrain. I just think the approach there needs to be different. AMANPOUR: Do you think the Libyans have the wherewithal to retaliate against the United States or its allies in the region or here?\n\nMULLEN: I don't think -- from a military standpoint, certainly, they have some capability. And -- and yet, at least if I were to take the first 24 hours or so, they've -- they've not been a very effective force.\n\nPart of what you do when you go into this is you assume they have a fairly significant capability or the capability they have is good until proven otherwise. We've taken out their air defense. We've actually stopped -- attacked -- we've attacked some of their forces on the ground in the vicinity of Benghazi. And yesterday they were on the march to Benghazi. They were lobbing rockets and mortars in Benghazi...\n\nAMANPOUR: So Benghazi is safe?\n\nMULLEN: Well, Benghazi -- they're no longer marching there. I wouldn't describe Benghazi as safe at this particular point in time.\n\nAMANPOUR: But even though you say you have to assume that they have some kind of capability, realistically, do you think Gadhafi can attack civilian aircraft targets and will do?\n\nMULLEN: Well, he still has -- from what I've seen this morning, he still has some surface-to-air capability, where he could attack an aircraft, including one of ours. We haven't seen large-scale indications of that after the action yesterday. He clearly has the ability to continue to attack his own people, and then we're very focused on that, and -- and trying to ensure that his military forces don't do that.\n\nAMANPOUR: Mustard gas stockpiles, is that a problem?\n\nMULLEN: Very closely monitored, and I haven't seen it as a problem thus far.\n\nAMANPOUR: Admiral Mullen, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.\n\nMULLEN: Thank you, Christiane.\n\nAMANPOUR: And we're covering the unfolding events in Libya from all angles this morning. Up next, I'll speak with a leader of the opposition movement who until recently worked for Gadhafi himself. He joins me with unique insight into the Libyan strongman.\n\nAnd later, will a new war abroad bring a new threat here in the United States? Could Gadhafi retaliate on American soil? I'll put that question to the former homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nH. CLINTON: The world will not sit idly by while more innocent civilians are killed. We are standing with the people of Libya, and we will not waver in our efforts to protect them.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So, as you heard his son, Saif, tell us, Moammar Gadhafi remains in Tripoli, presumably hunkered down. His Tripoli compound is reportedly filled with hundreds of supporters, including women and children. Could they make up a human shield, a possible last line of defense for the embattled leader?\n\nUntil just weeks ago, Ali Suleiman Aujali was Gadhafi's voice in the United States, the Libyan ambassador to this country. But Aujali has turned against Gadhafi and is now a leading voice of the opposition. He joins me here at the Newseum in Washington.\n\nAnd from New York, a man whose country led the call for air strikes we're seeing right now, France's ambassador to the United Nations, Gerard Araud.\n\nGentlemen, welcome, both, to this program.\n\nAUJALI: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you first, former Ambassador Aujali, what is in the mind of Gadhafi right now? This is a man you know, you served. Under this threat, will he fold?\n\nAUJALI: I think there is one thing in the mind of Gadhafi, that he will not step down at all. He will fight until the end.\n\nAMANPOUR: So everything that his son is telling us, that he's telling us is not just bravado?\n\nAUJALI: Yeah.\n\nAMANPOUR: He will fight?\n\nAUJALI: He will fight. He will fight. He has no other choice. He has no shelter to go. And this is his -- his attitude. He will never give up. ARAUD: Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR: So how will this end?\n\nAUJALI: Well, the end -- now I think there is a good chance after the air strikes, after the revolutionaries being protected by -- from the Gadhafi hitting, I think now they'll start marching to the -- to the east. And we have to -- we have to break the siege against Tripoli. If Tripoli...\n\nAMANPOUR: So you're hoping that the rebels will keep marching on to the capital...\n\nAUJALI: Of course. Of course. Of course.\n\nAMANPOUR: ... and take on Gadhafi himself?\n\nAUJALI: Of course. Yeah, we have to open the road, you know, to Gadhafi's -- where he's staying.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let me ask you, Ambassador Araud. This is pretty much an extraordinary situation. There is a military intervention, and France is the country that has led it and that has really brought the United States to this situation. You're listening to the ambassador here, Aujali. Why is it that France took that decision?\n\nARAUD: Well, I think it was, first, I guess, a moral and human reaction. It was impossible to consider a victory of Gadhafi and Gadhafi taking Benghazi. He was himself saying what will happen. He was saying that they -- they will search house by house. He was referring to rivers of blood. It was simply totally impossible to -- to accept it.\n\nYou have also to consider that, for us, Libya, the Maghreb, it's a bit like you, Central America and Cuba. In human and geographic terms, it's very close to -- to my country.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, then let me ask you, though. Now, then, are you on the side of the rebels? Is this the -- you know, making the rebels win, is that the aim of this current military operation?\n\nARAUD: We -- we do consider France as recognized -- the committee of Benghazi as the representative of the Libyan people. We simply want the Libyan people able to express their -- their will.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Aujali. You've heard Admiral Mullen clearly said the mission is to protect the citizens of Benghazi and -- and Libya and to open up humanitarian ability for them, not to take out Gadhafi, not to support the opposition. What do you understand by this resolution?\n\nAUJALI: I understand the mission is to protect the Libyan civilians, not only Benghazi. Protection of the Libyan civilian only achieved by one goal, that Gadhafi is not there, not only by stop his airplanes striking the people. The dangers is Gadhafi himself.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you understand, this military action is aimed to get rid of Gadhafi?\n\nAUJALI: Of course. If this is not the mission, then they would just hit some airplane -- shot the airplanes down and then leave was this madman, killing his people without mercy. This is...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you, Ambassador Araud. Is that the aim? Is that what the United States, France, and Britain have signed up to, to get rid of Colonel Gadhafi?\n\nARAUD: We want the Libyan people to be able to express their will, I've said, which -- and we consider that it means that Gadhafi has to go.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you concerned -- are you concerned that there will be retaliation? You've taken on this -- this military intervention. He has threatened retaliation against France, Britain, the United States, or at least their interests. Are you worried?\n\nARAUD: You know, when you enter a military intervention, it's never risk-free. So we have to be careful and to consider all the dangers. But, also, we know that Gadhafi is prone to empty rhetoric.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. Let me ask you one final question, Ambassador Aujali. This is designed to divide and conquer, to get Gadhafi's people away from him. You defected. Do you think that others around him will defect?\n\nAUJALI: Believe me, the people who are around him, especially the ministers, if they have a chance to defect, they will do it now, now, now. But he kept them -- he's keeping them in the Bab al-Azizia. They have no place to go...\n\nAMANPOUR: In his compound?\n\nAUJALI: In his compound. Then he's using them as a -- as a human shelter, also. But if they have a chance, they will defect. For example, I give you example, if you have some time. Then -- I have a friend of mine who was appointed the ambassador to Geneva. He's a young man, first time he's been appointed the head of mission. And when he left Tripoli with his credential, he just resigned.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. Well, we'll see what happens, whether the people around Gadhafi turn against him. Ambassador Araud in New York, thank you for joining us.\n\nAmbassador Aujali, thank you for joining us.\n\nAnd when we return, the big question: How -- now that the U.S. has struck at Libya, will Libya strike back? I'll discuss that with a high-powered roundtable that includes the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee and an architect of the war in Iraq.\n\nAnd later, we turn to the week's other major story, danger and devastation in Japan, as that country struggles to avert a full-scale nuclear meltdown. I'll ask former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and former Homeland Secretary Chief Michael Chertoff whether America is prepared to manage such a catastrophe.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Actions have consequences, and the writ of the international community must be enforced. Today we are part of a broad coalition, we are answering the calls of a threatened people, and we are acting in the interests of the United States and the world.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: President Obama right there -- excuse me -- explaining why American missiles and allied air strikes are now raining down on Libya, emphasizing that this is a broad international effort. As noteworthy as what the president said yesterday is what he left out, namely, his recent declaration that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi must go.\n\nThis is a momentous time in America's relations with the Arab world. And joining he today to discuss its far-reaching implications, ABC's George Will, former Congresswoman Jane Harman, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, Paul Wolfowitz, former deputy secretary of defense under George W. Bush and a mastermind of the war in Iraq, and Robin Wright of the U.S. Institute of Peace, author of \"Rock the Casbah: Rage and Rebellion Across the Islamic World.\"\n\nThank you all for joining me. And let me ask you first, George, do you think that this was the right thing to do?\n\nWILL: I do not. We have intervened in a tribal society in a civil war. And we have taken sides in that civil war on behalf of people we do not know or understand for the purpose -- not avowed, but inexorably our purpose -- of creating a political vacuum by decapitating that government. Into that vacuum, what will flow? We do not know and cannot know.\n\nAMANPOUR: Paul Wolfowitz, you disagree with George?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: I do. I think that what we have prevented, for one thing, is a bloodbath in Benghazi, which would have stained our reputation throughout the Arab world, at a time when our reputation really matters. And I understand George's hesitations, but it would seem to me, if you follow those hesitations, you say, it's better to keep this devil that we know than the unknown, and I don't see how any unknown could be worse than the devil who is in Tripoli right now. AMANPOUR: Except wouldn't you say the hesitation -- you can trace it right back to your operation in Iraq, that, you know, it caused such a pendulum swing against trying to intervene because of the chaos that was unleashed.\n\nWOLFOWITZ: We have paid the price of intervention. Sometimes we've paid the price of nonintervention, in Bosnia, for example. One of the things that makes the situation so unique is the monstrous quality of the Tripoli regime, the monstrous quality of Gadhafi and his sons. And I know, you know, people say, well, what about Bahrain? What about Yemen? This is a totally different case, where a man is actually slaughtering his own people, has no regard for his own people. He uses mercenaries to kill them. It is a unique case, and it's being watched throughout the Arab world.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you, former congresswoman. You sat on the Intelligence Committee. You -- I mean, this question about why Libya and not Bahrain or -- or Yemen, American allies, is that a valid distinction to make?\n\nHARMAN: I think it is. First, let me salute the life and service of Warren Christopher, a dear friend from California, who died yesterday and say how honored I am now to be president and CEO of the Woodrow Wilson Center, succeeding Lee Hamilton, and working with scholars like Robin and Aaron David Miller and others.\n\nI think we have to see this in a broader context. I just watched your Mike Mullen interview, where he said we -- we view each of these countries individually. We need a strategic narrative.\n\nAnd as I look at this, from my experience being in Congress when we did nothing in Rwanda, which Bill Clinton said was his biggest mistake, when we intervened in -- in Bosnia, did a no-fly zone, which didn't prevent the -- the massacre at Srebrenica, when we -- when Congress acted in Afghanistan, the authorization to use military force is still in effect, and then we took our eye off the ball, when we went into Iraq, I voted for that, because I believed the intelligence, which turned out to be wrong, I see lessons to be learned, and I'm not sure we're learning all the lessons.\n\nAs I look at it, the biggest threats to the United States, to our homeland security, are Yemen and some of the Al Qaida and other terror cells in Pakistan. Going into Libya has a moral objective, and I strongly agree with that. And I also think that Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice, who were strong proponents of what we're doing here, are great public servants.\n\nBut we have to understand that just a no-fly zone here may not cause regime change. And if we have a cornered Moammar Gadhafi -- who is not a rational actor -- and he uses mustard gas against his people, how have we...\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, actually -- Admiral Mullen...\n\nHARMAN: ... how have we prevented that?\n\nAMANPOUR: Admiral Mullen said that there wasn't a huge amount of threat there.\n\nHARMAN: There are two tons of liquefied mustard gas in Libya.\n\nAMANPOUR: Yeah, but he said he hasn't seen any movement of that.\n\nHARMAN: Not yet. We've only been there for 24 hours.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think it's a threat?\n\nHARMAN: I worry about that. I mean, we can't take out mustard gas by air. If we blow it up, we disperse it. And I worry about a guy who's going to fight to the end -- and that's what we just heard from the former ambassador -- and is not a rational actor, doing things like that, putting human shields around all the obvious targets, including his own -- his own living quarters, and taking Westerners as hostages and possibly engaging in terror acts and going down with as much bloodshed as possible.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you. You've interviewed him; I've interviewed him. A lot of people have. Is he the crazy man that Representative Harman talks about? Or is he going to either fold or be turned on by his own people?\n\nWRIGHT: He could prolong this for a very long time. This is not a man who plays by international rules, nor is he a man who thinks like even many of his counterparts in the Arab world, and that's why I think you've seen a great deal of unity in the Arab world against him. This is someone that everyone in Africa, in the Arab world...\n\nAMANPOUR: Which is really unusual, to have such a big Arab coalition against a fellow Arab leader.\n\nWRIGHT: And we haven't had one like this since the Iraq war back in 1990-1991. And that's what's, in fact, given the international community the legs. Without that, we probably would not be engaged.\n\nBut this is a very different kind of war. This is a country that's the size of Alaska with a population smaller than New York City. And so when we talk about the -- the kind of scenarios down the road, this is -- you know, most of the cities are along the coastal strip -- that it may not be as complicated as a place like Iraq was. This is -- you know, there are obvious targets and obvious sequence of places that either side will go. But there is mission gap between saying we want regime change and we're in there militarily for humanitarian. And that's where the problem is.\n\nAMANPOUR: Should it be regime change?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: Look, I think one of the most important pieces that's missing here is our connection with this transitional national council in Benghazi. They are -- they have representatives from all over the country. They seem to be setting up rules that are respectable rules.\n\nAMANPOUR: Really? Are you convinced about that? Who are they?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: Well, I'm not convinced. Well, I think we should have people in there so we really know better who they are. And we ought to be thinking of them as a leading edge here. I think it's been right to get an international coalition out in front and not make this all American, but most of all, it's a Libyan fight. What's been amazing over the last month is how brave the Libyan people have been. And I think -- across the whole country. this is not just a tribal thing in the east.\n\nAMANPOUR: But -- but when it comes, then, to lessons learned, what happens then with a Bahrain or a Yemen? I mean, isn't this a double standard?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: Look, excuse me: Libya is a separate case all by itself. You cannot...\n\nAMANPOUR: It is or it isn't.\n\nWOLFOWITZ: No, no, you can't -- you can't compare the regime in Bahrain or even the regime in Sana'a to Gadhafi. But, yes, there is a certain -- there's something in common here, which is that regimes that don't represent their people are not only wrong, they're ultimately unstable. And I think what we should be working for in Bahrain, what we should be working for in Yemen are governments that are much more representative of their people so that we can work with them better. But they're not -- it's absolutely wrong to compare what's happening there with what Gadhafi is -- is doing and has been doing for 40 years.\n\nWILL: There is no limiting principle in what we've done. If we are to protect people who are under assault, then where people are under assault in Bahrain, we are logically -- not only logically committed to help them, we are inciting them to rise in expectation. The mission creep here began, Paul, before the mission began, because we had a means not suited to the end. The means is a no-fly zone. That will not affect the end, which is obviously regime change.\n\nWRIGHT: Look, Yemen and Bahrain have the same problem that we do in Libya. Forty-five people were killed by the regime in Yemen, peaceful protests on Friday. You have the same thing in Bahrain.\n\nThis is -- the Obama administration has been responding very slowly at the outset to this kind of colossal transformation in the Arab world, and it's finally begun to kind of -- in response to what's happened in Tunisia, then in Egypt, and now in Libya, but it -- to develop a strategy, but it doesn't have a policy across the region that is consistent. And I think it's going to catch us at some point.\n\nHARMAN: Two points. I agree with that. We don't have a security narrative across the world. And we absolutely need that, because these countries are connected to each other. One fruit vendor who immolates himself in the boonies in Tunisia has set off a firestorm, an earthquake -- let's use Japan as the metaphor -- across the region.\n\nTwo points about this. One, Congress. The leaders of Congress were briefed last Friday at the -- in the Situation Room. Many were part of the recess and weren't there. That is not, by my lights, briefing Congress. Congress needs to be called back and discuss this and authorize or limit...\n\nAMANPOUR: Isn't it too late?\n\nHARMAN: ... the mission. No, I think the president is lawfully acting under his emergency powers as commander-in-chief and the U.N. resolution. And we didn't ask Congress to approve Bosnia. But I think Congress needs to act.\n\nThe other thing is, this is a zero-sum game militarily. We are stretched to the limit. And the assets we put into Libya we are taking away from somewhere else. And it's not just warships, people, and money. It's brain cells.\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. Let me then ask you -- since you've just said that, last lightning round then. Is this, as the president said, in the U.S. national interest?\n\nWILL: It is not worth war.\n\nAMANPOUR: U.S. national interest?\n\nHARMAN: It is not as direct a threat to us as Yemen and Pakistan.\n\nAMANPOUR: U.S. national interests?\n\nWOLFOWITZ: I think, if Gadhafi were to survive, it would be very much against American interest, very seriously so.\n\nWRIGHT: We were within 24 hours probably of losing Benghazi, which would have been losing Libya. So you have to ask yourself, how important is Libya to the broader scheme of things? And it had become the new model. After peaceful transitions in Egypt and Tunisia, you began to see a new model in Libya and the use of force, and that's where it became dangerous.\n\nAMANPOUR: So within 24 hours, was it a desperation move, then?\n\nWRIGHT: I think that we were very close to the point of not being able to intervene at all, because it would have become Gadhafi's baby -- his country again.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, certainly everybody is going to be watching this and keeping a very close eye. Thank you all very much, indeed.\n\nAnd when we return, the other story making global headlines this week, the disaster in the Pacific. The nuclear crisis in Japan raises a disturbing question: What if it happened here? Could it? Is the United States prepared to respond to a full-scale nuclear meltdown? I'll ask the man who coordinated the federal response to a host of national disasters, former Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff. He'll join me. And so will Bill Richardson, who's grappled with issues of nuclear safety as diplomat, energy secretary, and governor of New Mexico. I'll ask them whether the U.S. should be ready for a possible terrorist attack sponsored by Moammar Gadhafi.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: In Japan today, workers at the Fukushima nuclear power plant are struggling to contain radiation, as fears of contamination spread across the country. Officials abandoned a plan to release more radioactive gasses into the air to relieve pressure at the crippled reactor. And the government announced the plant itself would be scrapped once the emergency is resolved.\n\nAnd this troubling news: Higher than normal levels of radiation has been found in spinach and milk. That's been detected from farms about 90 miles from the reactor.\n\nThe harrowing images we've seen day after day have many Americans asking one question: Could it happen here?\n\nThere are 104 nuclear reactors scattered around the country in some 31 states. At least a dozen are in areas at moderate to high risk of an earthquake. So what happens if a natural disaster sets off a catastrophic domino effect here in America? Is the government prepared to respond?\n\nJoining me now to answer that question, Michael Chertoff, who served as secretary of homeland security in the Bush administration, and he's also chairman of the Chertoff Group. And with us, Bill Richardson, who wears many hats. He was Bill Clinton's energy secretary and ambassador to the United Nations and most recently served as governor of New Mexico.\n\nGentlemen, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.\n\nJust before we get to the crucial issue of Japan and nuclear energy, let me ask you regarding Gadhafi's threats and the possibility of terrorism. Your job was to protect the homeland here. Do you think there's an increased risk now with this military activity over Libya?\n\nCHERTOFF: I think you have to assume there's an increased risk in the sense that Gadhafi is a proven terrorist, and it's wise to assume that he's got the intent at some point to do something to retaliate.\n\nBut I think his capability has been much degraded. For one thing, we have raised the level of our protection and our security over the years. I think his capability in the U.S. is not that great. If this operates today as it did when I was in office, we already have unfolded a plan to track all of his operatives in the United States and to make sure they're not in a position to do something. So...\n\nAMANPOUR: So you're really prepared here for that?\n\nCHERTOFF: I think we are prepared for this, but, again, the important thing is to continue to watch him not only here in the U.S., but look at American interests overseas, including people who are traveling or people who may be living overseas, as well.\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, his son said, no, that's not our target, when I asked him about retaliation. I mean...\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, you know, he's like a cornered rat. And a cornered rat will do whatever it has to do in order to defend itself or to strike back. So while right now my suspicion is they have their hands full, it's certainly something -- it's prudent to consider that he may seek to divert attention or even to push back by striking someplace else.\n\nBut, again, his capability now is not what it was 10 years ago. And more importantly, we've got a much more robust security apparatus.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Governor Richardson, do you think that the U.S. is more at risk?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, I don't want to be an alarmist. And I agree with what the secretary said. But he's a very unpredictable -- he's almost a wild man right now. He's cornered. My concern is, does he have any chemical weapons? I am concerned about these mustard gas reports.\n\nAMANPOUR: We asked Admiral Mullen about that.\n\nRICHARDSON: No, I know what he said, but my concern is, there are some allegations that he was directly responsible for Lockerbie. My concern is, Americans in the Mediterranean flying I think should be extra cautious.\n\nI don't want to be an alarmist, but when a man is cornered who is desperate, who wants to cling on to power, who sees his base narrowing, who is attacked, could be capable, as he has in the past, very horrendous things.\n\nAMANPOUR: Let's turn to the other major, major story, this potential cataclysmic meltdown. Is there -- is the United States totally prepared to handle something like that? Could that happen here?\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, let's -- let's define what we mean by handle. If you had a -- an earthquake that resulted in serious damage, devastating damage to a nuclear power plant -- and I'm saying that that would happen -- it would be a very ugly situation.\n\nThe critical issue would be to evacuate people in a timely fashion. Now, as part of the process of putting these plans in and as part of our general planning process, we have worked to develop evacuation plans. But make no mistake: They have to be drilled. They have to be exercised. And if that hasn't been done, it's going to become a challenge.\n\nAMANPOUR: Has it been done?\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, I think it varies. I mean, if you look at California, they tend to be very good about the process of preparation. Other states may not be quite as intense about it.\n\nThe thing to remember is this, though: No matter how good you are, it's going to be very difficult. And the way to minimize the difficulty is to have people be self-reliant, to have them well prepared, to make sure they're educated so they can take their own actions to get out of the way if, in fact, it looks like we're going to have a problem.\n\nAMANPOUR: And, Governor, you were governor of New Mexico when Secretary Chertoff was in office. To your mind, is the federal government prepared if it happened somewhere near your state?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, I can tell you that states generally are not prepared. And so we rely on the federal government. And -- and I believe the secretary's right. The federal government has to lead.\n\nI think the big message here is -- from -- from the Japanese crisis is that we're looking at what happened in the oil spill, what happened with the mining disaster in West Virginia, the pipeline explosion. We have to look at the safety, cost, environmental risks of all our energy production. And I think the message with the nuclear reactors in Japan is that we should look at all our 104 reactors in the United States for their safety and preparedness within NRC.\n\nAMANPOUR: And when you were governor -- you were saying the states aren't prepared -- but did you believe that the federal government was prepared?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, I think this tragedy in Japan indicates that we need to be better prepared, that...\n\nAMANPOUR: So is that a yes or a no?\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, I think -- I think, again, Christiane, you have to have a realistic expectation. I think the federal government is -- has a general plan for catastrophic incidents. I think there are capabilities that could be deployed.\n\nBut recognizing, the initial hours after any kind of catastrophe, the government is not going to rescue everybody. That's not possible. And part of what I used to say and what Secretary Napolitano is saying is, preparation begins at the home and at the business level.\n\nAnd that means, if you're in an area which is earthquake-prone, you've got to have a plan in place to evacuate if necessary, or you've got to know how to shelter yourself. Now, there's going to be a big exercise in May, in the central part of the country, the New Madrid earthquake fault, which we put in process several years ago. And that's a great opportunity for communities to take a -- a second look at their plans and make sure they're really serious and well-prepared.\n\nAMANPOUR: So what scares you most as a former governor and having to rely on the federal government for this kind of rescue?\n\nRICHARDSON: Well, first of all, we need to have evacuation plans. I don't think we have adequate ones around the country.\n\nSecondly, we have to look at licensing of new nuclear power plants. The president wants to proceed with 20 in the next decade. We want to have loan guarantees. But I think we have to have a timeout on nuclear power.\n\nAMANPOUR: So is that -- a timeout?\n\nRICHARDSON: A timeout, not -- not a moratorium, a timeout, review the safety and cost of all these plants, with the new licensing plants. Let's look at those that are being proposed in earthquake- prone areas. Let's look at those that are in seismic -- where there's intensive seismic material.\n\nAnd then, lastly, look at the ones -- and there's about a third of our nuclear plants that have some of this Japanese technology that obviously has not worked. And I think internationally we have to have some leadership in the whole range of the coolants in these reactors, the spent fuel. We have to look at ways that the international community, the international atomic energy commission looks at ways that there can be standardized safety procedures.\n\nAMANPOUR: Do you think there needs to be a timeout?\n\nCHERTOFF: Well, I -- I agree with Bill, we need to obviously look at the lessons learned from what's happened in Japan. But what I would caution against is overreacting, even to this catastrophic event.\n\nYou know, we had a problem with BP in the gulf, and the reaction was, we can't drill in the gulf. We have problems with other forms of energy, and people say, well, we shouldn't do that.\n\nWell, you know, at the end of the day, if we don't use coal, oil, natural gas, or nuclear, we're going to be sitting around the fire trying to warm ourselves like we did eons ago.\n\nSo we're going to have to manage risk. That doesn't mean guaranteeing against any -- it means having in place ways to mitigate problems. And that's where I think the lessons of Japan can be very, very helpful.\n\nRICHARDSON: And I think the lesson, also, for America is, we have to look at renewable energy, natural gas, clean sources, but reassess our entire safety procedures when it comes to our fossil fuels. When it -- look what happened in -- in the gulf. Look what happened in these mining disasters. A new conversation about safety, cost, and environmental risk of our energy production.\n\nAMANPOUR: A new conversation, indeed. Thank you both very much for joining us. Secretary Chertoff, Governor Richardson, thank you for coming in.\n\nAnd we'll have a final thought when we come back. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: A week ago, I was in Japan. This program was broadcast out of there after we were covering the aftermath of the terrible earthquake and tsunami. And with me, a team of ABC correspondents, reporting on all the aspects of the unfolding tragedy, including the nuclear accident.\n\nWhen we returned to the United States, we gathered to discuss the stories that we all didn't get a chance to report on the air. And you can find that conversation at abcnews.com, where you can always get the latest developments on Japan and Libya. And, of course, \"World News with David Muir\" will have a full wrap of the day's events. And ABC will have all the news across all the platforms.\n\nThank you for watching \"This Week,\" and I'll see you again next Sunday."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. troops could withdraw from Iraq within months, but if Iraq's government remains politically deadlocked, it probably would collapse and the nation would descend into chaos, a war game organized by the U.S. Army concluded earlier this month.\n\nThe war gamers, following a scenario created by their Army hosts, determined that U.S. troops would secure the exit route to Kuwait through largely Shiite Muslim southern Iraq and face little fighting as they drove their equipment out. Any attacks, the panel judged, would be \"harassment attacks,\" likely by a few Sunni members of al Qaida in Iraq who wanted to attack American troops one last time.\n\n\"Why would they stop us? They have been telling us to leave,\" said one participant who requested anonymity to speak freely about the war game.\n\nOnce U.S. troops left, however, the chaos in Iraq would escalate. Shiite militias would drive Baghdad's Sunni population into Iraq's western Anbar province, which is almost exclusively Sunni, the war gamers concluded. There would be a power struggle within Anbar among tribes backed by outside Sunni Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Syria.\n\nRival Shiite factions would fight one another to control much of the rest of the country, and Iran presumably would back one side, although the gamers couldn't assess how overt Iranian interference would be. Turkey would consider entering Iraq from the north to thwart the Kurds, who desire independence and claim some of Turkey as part of their homeland.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki's government would be unable to control the country. Indeed, the gamers concluded, his government could collapse unless Iran threw its support behind it.\n\n\"The mess we would leave behind would be awful,\" the participant said. \"The ethnic cleansing is happening now. Once we're gone, absent a political solution that would allow the Iraqi Army to go into action, all of that will be accelerated.\"\n\nThe Army staged the one-day exercise earlier this month at a Hilton hotel in suburban Springfield, Va., and invited 30 Iraq experts, among them serving and retired officers and Iraqi exiles.\n\nThe organizers picked April 2008 as a starting point \u2014 the month after which U.S. commanders have said they can't maintain the surge of additional U.S. forces and still give troops a year off between 15-month deployments \u2014 and January 2009 as the end. They played the roles of the Sunnis, the Shiites, the insurgents, the militias, the military generals and the Iraqi government.\n\nThe game was one of several simulations of what Iraq might look like in the 2009 time frame if U.S. troops leave, said retired Marine Col. Gary Anderson, who participated in the Springfield exercise and several previous such games. But he said the Army hasn't yet staged an exercise premised on an abrupt withdrawal.\n\nThat the military war games are focusing on the potential chaos in Iraq, rather than an abrupt troop withdrawal, offers some insight into how the Pentagon is planning for the next stage of the war, several of the participants told McClatchy Newspapers.\n\n\"It will be as easy to get out as it was to get in,\" said one senior defense official, who declined to speak on the record about possible future operations. He said he believes that U.S. forces could get out of Iraq in as little as six months.\n\nBut the military insists that there's no withdrawal plan at this time.\n\n\"Tell us the policy, and we will do it,\" one senior Pentagon official said.\n\nCritics said the military is underestimating how hard it'll be to get out of Iraq. They point to Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, which boosted the fortunes of the militant Shiite Islamic group Hezbollah, and the Soviet Union's hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, which cost more than 500 Soviet troops their lives.\n\nRep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., a retired Navy vice admiral who was director of defense policy for the National Security Council in the Clinton administration, said he believes that drawing down or withdrawing troops could be one of the most dangerous periods of the Iraq war.\n\n\"The military will be vulnerable ... You are going to go out in a combat situation,\" Sestak said. \"I think we can do greater damage if we don't have a firm grasp on the military implications.\"\n\nU.S. troops are likely to leave an Iraq that's still embroiled in fierce sectarian violence, he said. \"How quickly can the military move its 160,000 troops out? What about the 100,000-plus contractors? How many of the military's 45,000 Humvees should be left behind for the Iraqi Army? Which of 64 military bases should be closed? How does the military protect its main route out of Iraq toward Kuwait?\"\n\nSestak estimates that it would take at long as two years to withdraw.\n\nAmerica's future in Iraq will be at center stage next month, when Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. envoy there, give an assessment and recommendation to Congress on Iraq's security and political situation.\n\nThe war gamers' only issue was getting out and at what cost.\n\nBy the end of the game, the players decided that the exercise had \"captured how bad it would be,\" said the participant who declined to be identified.\n\n\"I don't worry about how we will get out of Iraq,\" Anderson concluded about the latest war game. \"I am worried about the Iraqis we will kill on the way out.\""

    "text": "MAKING OF A CANDIDATE\n\nObama knows his way around a ballot\n\nSome say his ability to play political hardball goes back to his first campaign\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nnext\n\nThe day after New Year's 1996, operatives for Barack Obama filed into a barren hearing room of the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners.\n\n\n\nThere they began the tedious process of challenging hundreds of signatures on the nominating petitions of state Sen. Alice Palmer, the longtime progressive activist from the city's South Side. And they kept challenging petitions until every one of Obama's four Democratic primary rivals was forced off the ballot.\n\n\n\nFresh from his work as a civil rights lawyer and head of a voter registration project that expanded access to the ballot box, Obama launched his first campaign for the Illinois Senate saying he wanted to empower disenfranchised citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in that initial bid for political office, Obama quickly mastered the bare-knuckle arts of Chicago electoral politics. His overwhelming legal onslaught signaled his impatience to gain office, even if that meant elbowing aside an elder stateswoman like Palmer.\n\n\n\nA close examination of Obama's first campaign clouds the image he has cultivated throughout his political career: The man now running for president on a message of giving a voice to the voiceless first entered public office not by leveling the playing field, but by clearing it.\n\n\n\nOne of the candidates he eliminated, long-shot contender Gha-is Askia, now says that Obama's petition challenges belied his image as a champion of the little guy and crusader for voter rights.\n\n\n\n\"Why say you're for a new tomorrow, then do old-style Chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates?\" Askia said. \"He talks about honor and democracy, but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot-free? Why not let the people decide?\"\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview, Obama granted that \"there's a legitimate argument to be made that you shouldn't create barriers to people getting on the ballot.\"\n\n\n\nBut the unsparing legal tactics were justified, he said, by obvious flaws in his opponents' signature sheets. \"To my mind, we were just abiding by the rules that had been set up,\" Obama recalled.\n\n\n\n\"I gave some thought to \u2026 should people be on the ballot even if they didn't meet the requirements,\" he said. \"My conclusion was that if you couldn't run a successful petition drive, then that raised questions in terms of how effective a representative you were going to be.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether the district's primary voters were well-served by having only one candidate, Obama smiled and said: \"I think they ended up with a very good state senator.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nObama behind challenges\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nnext\n\nAmerica has been defined in part by civil rights and good government battles fought out in Chicago's 13th District, which in 1996 spanned Hyde Park mansions, South Shore bungalows and poverty-bitten precincts of Englewood.It was in this part of the city that an eager reform Democrat by the name of Abner Mikva first entered elected office in the 1950s. And here a young, brash minister named Jesse Jackson ran Operation Breadbasket, leading marchers who sought to pressure grocery chains to hire minorities.Palmer served the district in the Illinois Senate for much of the 1990s. Decades earlier, she was working as a community organizer in the area when Obama was growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia. She risked her safe seat to run for Congress and touted Obama as a suitable successor, according to news accounts and interviews.But when Palmer got clobbered in that November 1995 special congressional race, her supporters asked Obama to fold his campaign so she could easily retain her state Senate seat.Obama not only refused to step aside, he filed challenges that nullified Palmer's hastily gathered nominating petitions, forcing her to withdraw.\"I liked Alice Palmer a lot. I thought she was a good public servant,\" Obama said. \"It was very awkward. That part of it I wish had played out entirely differently.\"His choice divided veteran Chicago political activists.\"There was friction about the decision he made,\" said City Colleges of Chicago professor emeritus Timuel Black, who tried to negotiate with Obama on Palmer's behalf. \"There were deep disagreements.\"Had Palmer survived the petition challenge, Obama would have faced the daunting task of taking on an incumbent senator. Palmer's elimination marked the first of several fortuitous political moments in Obama's electoral success: He won the 2004 primary and general elections for U.S. Senate after tough challengers imploded when their messy divorce files were unsealed.\n\nMore articles\n\nGet chicagotribune.com news by e-mail.

    "text": "Obama delivers speech on the national debt\n\nSpeech Transcript\n\nOBAMA: It is wonderful to be back at G.W. I want you to know that one of the reasons that I worked so hard with Democrats and Republicans to keep the government open was so that I could show up here today.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI want to make sure that all of you had one more excuse to skip class.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI want to give a special thanks to Steven Knapp, the president of G.W. I just saw him. Where is he?\n\nThere he is, right here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI want to -- we've got a lot of distinguished guests here. A couple of people I want to acknowledge.\n\nFirst of all, my outstanding vice president, Joe Biden, is here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOur secretary of the treasury, Tim Geithner, is in the house.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nJack Lew, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGene Sperling, chair of the National Economic Council, is here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMembers of our bipartisan fiscal commission are here, including the two outstanding chairs -- Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson are here.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd we have a umber of members of Congress here today. I'm grateful for all of you taking the time to attend.\n\nWhat we've been debating here in Washington over the last few weeks will affect the lives of the students here and families all across America in potentially profound ways.\n\nThis debate over budgets and deficits is about more than just numbers on a page, it's about more than just cutting and spending. It's about the kind of future that we want.\n\nOBAMA: It's about the kind of country that we believe in. And that's what I want to spend some time talking about today.\n\nFrom our first days as a nation, we have put our faith in free markets and free enterprise as the engine of America's wealth and prosperity. And more than citizens of any other country, we are rugged individualists, a self-reliant people with a healthy skepticism of too much government.\n\nBut there has always been another thread running through our history: a belief that we're all connected and that there are some things we can only do together, as a nation.\n\nWe believe, in the words of the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, that through government, we should do together what we cannot do as well for ourselves.\n\nAnd so we've built a strong military to keep us secure, and public schools and universities to educate our citizens. We've laid down railroads and highways to facilitate travel and commerce.\n\nOBAMA: We've supported the work of scientists and researchers whose discoveries have saved lives, unleashed repeated technological revolutions, and led to countless new jobs and entire new industries.\n\nEach of us has benefited from these investments, and we're a more prosperous country as a result.\n\nNow, part of this American belief that we're all connected also expresses itself in a conviction that each one of us deserves some basic measure of security and dignity.\n\nWe recognize that, no matter how responsibly we live our lives, hard times or bad luck, a crippling illness or a layoff may strike any one of us. \"There but for the grace of God go I,\" we say to ourselves.\n\nAnd so we contribute to programs like Medicare and Social Security, which guarantee us health care and a measure of basic income after a lifetime of hard work; unemployment insurance, which protects us against unexpected job loss; and Medicaid, which provides care for millions of seniors in nursing homes, poor children, those with disabilities.\n\nOBAMA: We're a better country because of these commitments.\n\nI'll go further: We would not be a great country without those commitments.\n\nAnd for much of the last century, our nation found a way to afford these investments and priorities with the taxes paid by its citizens. As a country that values fairness, wealthier individuals have traditionally borne a greater share of this burden than the middle class or those less fortunate; everybody pays, but the wealthier have borne a little more.\n\nThis is not because we begrudge those who've done well. We rightly celebrate their success.\n\nInstead, it's a basic reflection of our belief that those who benefited most from our way of life can afford to give back a little -- a little bit more.\n\nOBAMA: Moreover, this belief hasn't hindered the success of those at the top of the income scale. They continue to do better and better with each passing year.\n\nNow, at certain times -- particularly during war or recession -- our nation has had to borrow money to pay for some of our priorities. And as most families understand, a little credit card debt isn't going to hurt, if it's temporary.\n\nBut as far back as the 1980s, America started amassing debt at more alarming levels, and our leaders began to realize that a larger challenge was on the horizon.\n\nThey knew that eventually, the baby boom generation would retire, which meant a much bigger portion of our citizens would be relying on programs like Medicare, Social Security and possibly Medicaid.\n\nLike parents with young children who know they have to start saving for the college years, America had to start borrowing less and saving more to prepare for the retirement of an entire generation.\n\nTo meet this challenge, our leaders came together three times during the 1990s to reduce our nation's deficit -- three times. They forged historic agreements that required tough decisions made by the first President Bush, then made by President Clinton, by Democratic Congresses and by a Republican Congress.\n\nAll three agreements asked for shared responsibility and shared sacrifice, but they largely protected the middle class, they largely protected our commitments to seniors, they protected our key investments in our future.\n\nAs a result of these bipartisan efforts, America's finances were in great shape by the year 2000. We went from deficit to surplus. America was actually on track to becoming completely debt-free, and we were prepared for the retirement of the baby boomers.\n\nBut after Democrats and Republicans committed to fiscal discipline during the 1990s, we lost our way in the decade that followed. We increased spending dramatically for two wars and an expensive prescription drug program, but we didn't pay for any of this new spending.\n\nOBAMA: Instead we made the problem worse with trillions of dollars in unpaid-for tax cuts; tax cuts that went to every millionaire and billionaire in the country; tax cuts that will force us to borrow an average of $500 billion every year over the next decade.\n\nTo give you an idea of how much damage this caused to our nation's checkbook, consider this.\n\nIn the last decade, if we had simply found a way to pay for the tax cuts and the prescription drug benefit, our deficit would currently be at low historical levels in the coming years.\n\nBut that's not what happened. And so, by the time I took office, we once again found ourselves deeply in debt and unprepared for a baby boom retirement that is now starting to take place.\n\nWhen I took office, our projected deficit annually was more than $1 trillion. On top of that, we faced a terrible financial crisis and a recession that, like most recessions, led us to temporarily borrow even more.\n\nIn this case, we took a series of emergency steps that saved millions of jobs, kept credit flowing, and provided working families extra money in their pocket. It was absolutely the right thing to do, but these steps were expensive and added to our deficits in the short term.\n\nSo that's how our fiscal challenge was created. That's how we got here. And now that our economic recovery is gaining strength, Democrats and Republicans must come together and restore the fiscal responsibility that served us so well in the 1990s.\n\nWe have to live within our means. We have to reduce our deficit. And we have to get back on a path that will allow us to pay down our debt.\n\nOBAMA: And we have to do it in a way that protects the recovery, protects the investments we need to grow, creates jobs, and helps us win the future.\n\nNow, before I get into how we can achieve this goal, some of you, particularly the younger people here -- you don't qualify, Joe...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... some of you might be wondering, \"Why is this so important? Why does this matter to me?\"\n\nWell, here's why.\n\nEven after our economy recovers, our government will still be on track to spend more money than it takes in throughout this decade and beyond. That means we'll have to keep borrowing more from countries like China.\n\nThat means more of your tax dollars each year will go towards paying off the interest on all of the loans that we keep taking out. By the end of this decade, the interest that we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion. Think about that. That's the interest, just the interest payments.\n\nThen, as the baby boomers start to retire in greater numbers and health care costs continue to rise, the situation will get even worse.\n\nBy 2025, the amount of taxes we currently pay will only be enough to finance our health care programs, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, and the interest we owe on our debt. That's it. Every other national priority -- education, transportation, even our national security -- will have to be paid for with borrowed money.\n\nNow, ultimately all this rising debt will cost us jobs and damage our economy. It will prevent us from making the investments we need to win the future.\n\nOBAMA: We won't be able to afford good schools, new research, or the repair of roads; all the things that create new jobs and businesses here in America.\n\nBusinesses will be less likely to invest and open shop in a country that seems unwilling or unable to balance its books. And if our creditors start worrying that we may be unable to pay back our debts, that could drive up interest rates for everybody who borrows money, making it harder for businesses to expand and hire or families to take out a mortgage.\n\nHere's the good news: That doesn't have to be our future; that doesn't have to be the country that we leave our children.\n\nWe can solve this problem. We came together as Democrats and Republicans to meet this challenge before; we can do it again. But that starts by being honest about what's causing our deficit.\n\nYou see, most Americans tend to dislike government spending in the abstract, but like the stuff that it buys.\n\nMost of us, regardless of party affiliation, believe that we should have a strong military and a strong defense. Most Americans believe we should invest in education and medical research. Most Americans think we should protect commitments like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nAnd without even looking at a poll, my finely honed political instincts tell me that almost nobody believes they should be paying higher taxes.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo because all this spending is popular with both Republicans and Democrats alike, and because nobody wants to pay higher taxes, politicians are often eager to feed the impression that solving the problem is just a matter of eliminating waste and abuse.\n\nOBAMA: You'll hear that phrase a lot: \"We just need to eliminate waste and abuse.\"\n\nThe implication is that tackling the deficit issue won't require tough choices.\n\nOr politicians suggest that we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about 1 percent of our entire federal budget.\n\nSo here's the truth.\n\nAround two-thirds of our budget -- two-thirds -- is spent on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and national security -- two- thirds.\n\nPrograms like unemployment insurance, student loans, veterans' benefits and tax credits for working families take up another 20 percent.\n\nWhat's left, after interest on the debt, is just 12 percent for everything else. That's 12 percent for all of our national priorities: education, clean energy, medical research, transportation, our national parks, food safety, keeping our air and water clean. You name it, all of that accounts for 12 percent of our budget.\n\nNow, up 'til now, the debate here in Washington -- the cuts proposed by a lot of folks in Washington have focused almost exclusively on that 12 percent.\n\nOBAMA: But cuts to that 12 percent alone won't solve the problem. So any serious plan to tackle our deficit will require us to put everything on the table and take on excess spending wherever it exists in the budget.\n\nA serious plan doesn't require us to balance our budget overnight. In fact, economists think that with the economy just starting to grow again we need a phased-in approach. But it does require tough decisions and support from our leaders in both parties now. Above all, it will require us to choose a vision of the America we want to see five years, 10 years, 20 years down the road.\n\nNow, to their credit, one vision has been presented and championed by Republicans in the House of Representatives and embraced by several of their party's presidential candidates. It's a plan that aims to reduce our deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years, and one that addresses the challenge of Medicare and Medicaid in the years after that.\n\nThose are both worthy goals. They're worthy goals for us to achieve.\n\nBut the way this plan achieves those goals would lead to a fundamentally different America than the one we've known, certainly in my lifetime. In fact, I think it would be fundamentally different than what we've known throughout our history.\n\nA 70 percent cut in clean energy, a 25 percent cut in education, a 30 percent cut in transportation, cuts in college Pell Grants that will grow to more than $1,000 per year.\n\nOBAMA: That's the proposal.\n\nThese aren't the kind of cuts you make when you're trying to get rid of some waste or find extra savings in the budget. These aren't the kind of cuts that the fiscal commission proposed.\n\nThese are the kind of cuts that tell us we can't afford the America that I believe in and I think you believe in.\n\nI believe it paints a vision of our future that is deeply pessimistic. It's a vision that says if our roads crumble and our bridges collapse, we can't afford to fix them; if there are bright young Americans who have the drive and the will but not the money to go to college, we can't afford to send them.\n\nGo to China and you'll see businesses opening research labs and solar facilities.\n\nSouth Korean children are outpacing our kids in math and science. They're scrambling to figure out how they put more money into education.\n\nBrazil is investing billions in new infrastructure and can run half their cars not on high-priced gasoline, but on biofuels.\n\nAnd yet, we are presented with a vision that says the American people, the United States of America, the greatest nation on Earth, can't afford any of this.\n\nIt's a vision that says America can't afford to keep the promise we've made to care for our seniors. It says that 10 years from now, if you're a 65-year-old who's eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today.\n\nIt says, instead of guaranteed health care, you will get a voucher. And if that voucher isn't worth enough to buy the insurance that's available in the open marketplace, well, tough luck; you're on your own.\n\nPut simply, it ends Medicare as we know it.\n\nIt's a vision that says up to 50 million Americans have to lose their health insurance in order for us to reduce the deficit.\n\nOBAMA: Who are these 50 million Americans?\n\nMany are somebody's grandparents, maybe one of yours, who wouldn't be able afford nursing home care without Medicaid.\n\nMany are poor children. Some are middle-class families who have children with autism or Down's syndrome. Some are these kids with disabilities are -- the disabilities are so severe that they require 24-hour care.\n\nThese are the Americans we'd be telling to fend for themselves.\n\nAnd, worst of all, this is a vision that says even though Americans can't afford to invest in education at current levels or clean energy, even though we can't afford to maintain our commitment on Medicare and Medicaid, we can somehow afford more than $1 trillion in new tax breaks for the wealthy.\n\nThink about that.\n\nIn the last decade, the average income of the bottom 90 percent of all working Americans actually declined. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent saw their income rise by an average of more than a quarter of a million dollars each. That's who needs to pay less taxes?\n\nThey want to give people like me a $200,000 tax cut that's paid for by asking 33 seniors to each pay $6,000 more in health costs.\n\nThat's not right, and that's not going to happen as long as I'm president.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThis vision is less about reducing the deficit than it is about changing the basic social compact in America. Ronald Reagan's own budget director said there's nothing serious or courageous about this plan.\n\nOBAMA: There's nothing serious about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. And I don't think there's anything courageous about asking for sacrifice from those who can least afford it and don't have any clout on Capitol Hill. That's not a vision of the America I know.\n\nThe America I know is generous and compassionate. It's a land of opportunity and optimism. Yes, we take responsibility for ourselves, but we also take responsibility for each other, for the country we want and the future that we share.\n\nWe're a nation that built a railroad across a continent and brought light to communities shrouded in darkness. We sent a generation to college on the G.I. Bill and we saved millions of seniors from poverty with Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWe have led the world in scientific research and technological breakthroughs that have transformed millions of lives.\n\nThat's who we are. This is the America that I know.\n\nWe don't have to choose between a future of spiraling debt and one where we forfeit our investment in our people and our country.\n\nTo meet our fiscal challenge, we will need to make reforms, we will all need to make sacrifices. But we do not have to sacrifice the America we believe in. And as long as I'm president, we won't.\n\nSo today I'm proposing a more balanced approach to achieve $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 12 years. It's an approach that borrows from the recommendations of the bipartisan fiscal commission that I appointed last year, and it builds on the roughly $1 trillion in deficit reduction I already proposed in my 2012 budget.\n\nOBAMA: It's an approach that puts every kind of spending on the table, but one that protects the middle class, our promise to seniors and our investments in the future.\n\nThe first step in our approach is to keep annual domestic spending low by building on the savings that both parties agreed to last week. That step alone will save us about $750 billion over 12 years.\n\nWe will make the tough cuts necessary to achieve these savings, including in programs that I deeply care about. But I will not sacrifice the core investments that we need to grow and create jobs. We will invest in medical research. We will invest in clean energy technology. We will invest in new roads and airports and broadband access. We will invest in education. We will invest in job training. We will do what we need to do to compete, and we will win the future.\n\nThe second step in our approach is to find additional savings in our defense budget.\n\nNow, as commander in chief, I have no greater responsibility than protecting our national security, and I will never accept cuts that compromise our ability to defend our homeland or America's interests around the world.\n\nBut as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, has said, the greatest long-term threat to America's national security is America's debt.\n\nOBAMA: So just as we must find more savings in domestic programs, we must do the same in defense. And we can do that while still keeping ourselves safe.\n\nOver the last two years, Secretary Bob Gates has courageously taken on wasteful spending, saving $400 billion in current and future spending. I believe we can do that again.\n\nWe need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and effectiveness, but we're going to have to conduct a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world.\n\nI intend to work with Secretary Gates and the Joint Chiefs on this review, and I will make specific decisions about spending after it's complete.\n\nThe third step in our approach is to further reduce health care spending in our budget. Now, here the difference with the House Republican plan could not be clearer.\n\nTheir plan essentially lowers the government's health care bills by asking seniors and poor families to pay them instead. Our approach lowers the government's health care bills by reducing the cost of health care itself.\n\nAlready, the reforms we passed in the health care law will reduce our deficit by $1 trillion. My approach would build on those -- these reforms.\n\nWe will reduce wasteful subsidies and erroneous payments. We will cut spending on prescription drugs by using Medicare's purchasing power to drive greater efficiency and speed generic brands of medicine onto the market. We will work with governors of both parties to demand more efficiency and accountability from Medicaid.\n\nWe will change the way we pay for health care: not by the procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to prevent injuries and improve results.\n\nAnd we will slow the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission of doctors, nurses, medical experts and consumers who will look at all the evidence and recommend the best ways to reduce unnecessary spending while protecting access to the services that seniors need.\n\nNow, we believe the reforms we've proposed to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid will enable us to keep these commitments to our citizens while saving us $500 billion by 2023, and an additional $1 trillion in the decade after that.\n\nOBAMA: But if we're wrong, and Medicare costs rise faster than we expect, then this approach will give the independent commission the authority to make additional savings by further improving Medicare.\n\nBut let me be absolutely clear: I will preserve these health care programs as a promise we make to each other in this society. I will not allow Medicare to become a voucher program that leaves seniors at the mercy of the insurance industry, with a shrinking benefit to pay for rising costs. I will not tell families with children who have disabilities that they have to fend for themselves.\n\nWe will reform these programs, but we will not abandon the fundamental commitment this country has kept for generations.\n\nThat includes, by the way, our commitment to Social Security. While Social Security is not the cause of our deficit, it faces real long-term challenges in a country that's growing older.\n\nAs I said in the State of the Union, both parties should work together now to strengthen Social Security for future generations. But we have to do it without putting at risk current retirees or the most vulnerable or people with disabilities, without slashing benefits for future generations and without subjecting Americans' guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market. And it can be done.\n\nThe fourth step in our approach is to reduce spending in the tax code, so-called tax expenditures.\n\nIn December, I agreed to extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans because it was the only way I could prevent a tax hike on middle-class Americans.\n\nOBAMA: But we cannot afford $1 trillion worth of tax cuts for every millionaire and billionaire in our society. We can't afford it. And I refuse to renew them again.\n\nBeyond that, the tax code is also loaded up with spending on things like itemized deductions. And while I agree with the goals of many of these deductions, from homeownership to charitable giving, we can't ignore the fact that they provide millionaires an average tax break of $75,000 but do nothing for the typical middle-class family that doesn't itemize.\n\nSo my budget calls for limiting itemized deductions for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, a reform that would reduce the deficit by $320 billion over 10 years.\n\nBut to reduce the deficit, I believe we should go further. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to reform our individual tax code so that it is fair and simple, so that the amount of taxes you pay isn't determined by what kind of accountant you can afford.\n\nI believe reform should protect the middle class, promote economic growth, and build on the fiscal commission's model of reducing tax expenditures so that there is enough savings to both lower rates and lower the deficit. And as I called for in the State of the Union, we should reform our corporate tax code as well, to make our businesses and our economy more competitive.\n\nSo this is my approach to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 12 years.\n\nOBAMA: It's an approach that achieves about $2 trillion in spending cuts across the budget. It will lower our interest payments on the debt by $1 trillion. It calls for tax reform to cut about $1 trillion in tax expenditures -- spending in the tax code. And it achieves these goals while protecting the middle class, protecting our commitment to seniors and protecting our investments in the future.\n\nNow, in the coming years, if the recovery speeds up and our economy grows faster than our current projections, we can make even greater progress than I've pledged here.\n\nBut just to hold Washington and to hold me accountable and make sure that the debt burden continues to decline, my plan includes a debt failsafe.\n\nIf, by 2014, our debt is not projected to fall as a share of the economy, if we haven't hit our targets, if Congress has failed to act, then my plan will require us to come together and make up the additional savings with more spending cuts and more spending reductions in the tax code.\n\nAnd that should be an incentive for us to act boldly now, instead of kicking our problems further down the road.\n\nSo this is our vision for America, this is my vision for America, a vision where we live within our means while still investing in our future, where everyone makes sacrifices but no one bears all the burden, where we provide a basic measure of security for our citizens and we provide rising opportunity for our children.\n\nThere will be those who vigorously disagree with my approach. I can guarantee that as well.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSome will argue we should not even consider -- ever, ever -- raising taxes, even if only on the wealthiest Americans.\n\nOBAMA: It's just an article of faith to them.\n\nI say that at a time when the tax burden on the wealthy is at its lowest level in half a century, the most fortunate among us can afford to pay a little more.\n\nI don't need another tax cut. Warren Buffett doesn't need another tax cut. Not if we have to pay for it by making seniors pay more for Medicare or by cutting kids from Head Start or by taking away college scholarships that I wouldn't be here without, and that some of you wouldn't be here without.\n\nAnd here's the thing: I believe that most wealthy Americans would agree with me. They want to give back to their country, a country that's done so much for them. It's just Washington hasn't asked them to.\n\nOthers will say that we shouldn't even talk about cutting spending until the economy is fully recovered. These are mostly folks in my party.\n\nI'm sympathetic to this view, which is one of the reasons I supported the payroll tax cuts we passed in December. It's also why we have to use a scalpel and not a machete to reduce the deficit, so that we can keep making the investments that create jobs.\n\nBut doing nothing on the deficit is just not an option. Our debt has grown so large that we could do real damage to the economy if we don't begin a process now to get our fiscal house in order.\n\nFinally, there are those who believe we shouldn't make any reforms to Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security out of fear that any talk of change to these programs will immediately usher in the sort of radical steps that House Republicans have proposed. And I understand those fears.\n\nOBAMA: But I guarantee that if we don't make any changes at all, we won't be able to keep our commitment to a retiring generation that will live longer and will face higher health care costs than those who came before.\n\nIndeed, to those in my own party, I say that if we truly believe in a progressive vision of our society, we have an obligation to prove that we can afford our commitments.\n\nIf we believe that government can make a difference in people's lives, we have the obligation to prove that it works, by making government smarter and leaner and more effective.\n\nOf course, there are those who simply say there's no way we can come together at all and agree on a solution to this challenge. They'll say the politics of this city are just too broken, the choices are just too hard, the parties are just too far apart.\n\nAnd after a few years on this job I have some sympathy for this view.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut I also know that we've come together before and met big challenges.\n\nRonald Reagan and Tip O'Neill came together to save Social Security for future generations.\n\nThe first President Bush and a Democratic Congress came together to reduce the deficit.\n\nPresident Clinton and a Republican Congress battled each other ferociously -- disagreed on just about everything -- but they still found a way to balance the budget.\n\nOBAMA: And in the last few months, both parties have come together to pass historic tax relief and spending cuts. And I know there are Republicans and Democrats in Congress who want to see a balanced approach to deficit reduction.\n\nAnd even those Republicans I disagree with most strongly I believe are sincere about wanting to do right by their country. We may disagree on our visions, but I -- I -- I truly believe they want to do the right thing.\n\nSo I believe we can and must come together again.\n\nThis morning, I met with Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress to discuss the approach that I laid out today. And in early May, the vice president will begin regular meetings with leaders in both parties with the aim of reaching a final agreement on a plan to reduce the deficit and get it done by the end of June.\n\nI don't expect the details in any final agreement to look exactly like the approach I laid out today. This is a democracy; that's not how things work. I'm eager to hear other ideas from all ends of the political spectrum.\n\nAnd though I'm sure the criticism of what I've said here today will be fierce in some quarters and my critique of the House Republican approach has been strong, Americans deserve and will demand that we all make an effort to bridge our differences and find common ground.\n\nThis larger debate that we're having -- this larger debate about the size and the role of government -- it has been with us since our founding days. And during moments of great challenge and change, like the one that we're living through now, the debate gets sharper and it gets more vigorous. That's not a bad thing. In fact, it's a good thing.\n\nOBAMA: As a country that prizes both our individual freedom and our obligations to one another, this is one of the most important debates that we can have.\n\nBut no matter what we argue, no matter where we stand, we've always held certain beliefs as Americans.\n\nWe believe that in order to preserve our own freedoms and pursue our own happiness, we can't just think about ourselves. We have to think about the country that made these liberties possible. We have to think about our fellow citizens with whom we share a community. And we have to think about what's required to preserve the American dream for future generations.\n\nThis sense of responsibility -- to each other and to our country -- this isn't a partisan feeling. This isn't a Democratic or a Republican idea. It's patriotism.\n\nThe other day I received a letter from a man in Florida. He started off by telling me he didn't vote for me and he hasn't always agreed with me. But even though he's worried about our economy and the state of our politics, here's what he said.\n\nHe said, \"I still believe. I believe in that great country that my grandfather told me about. I believe that somewhere lost in this quagmire of petty bickering on every news station, the American dream is still alive.\"\n\n\"We need to use our dollars here rebuilding, refurbishing and restoring all that our ancestors struggled to create and maintain. We as a people must do this together, no matter the color of the state one comes from or the side of the aisle one might sit on.\"\n\nI still believe -- I still believe as well. And I know that if we can come together and uphold our responsibilities to one another and to this larger enterprise that is America, we will keep the dream of our founding alive in our time, and we will pass it on to our children, we will pass on to our children a country that we believe in.\n\nThank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nEND .ETX\n\nApr 13, 2011 14:40 ET .EOF"

Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you.\n\nBefore we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama.\n\nSEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal.\n\nNow, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America.\n\nAnd if we do those things, then I believe that we can actually get Ohio back on the path of growth and jobs and prosperity. If we don't, then we're going to continue to see the kind of deterioration that we've seen economically here in this state.\n\nMR. RUSSERT: I want to ask you both about NAFTA because the record, I think, is clear. And I want to -- Senator Clinton. Senator Obama said that you did say in 2004 that on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America. You did say that. When President Clinton signed this bill -- and this was after he negotiated two new side agreements, for labor and environment -- President Clinton said it would be a force for economic growth and social progress. You said in '96 it was proving its worth as free and fair trade. You said that -- in 2000 -- it was a good idea that took political courage. So your record is pretty clear.\n\nBased on that, and which you're now expressing your discomfort with it, in the debate that Al Gore had with Ross Perot, Al Gore said the following: \"If you don't like NAFTA and what it's done, we can get out of it in six months."

Hammer has released its year-end 2010 results for the credit industry penalty fees assessed during the past year. This is the fourth in the Hammer annual series of seven year-end reports, dealing with all aspects of credit card industry trends: risks, costs, and profits. Some of the report highlights are: Card penalty fees assessed during 2010 totaled $22.5 Billion in the latest Hammer model. This is down slightly from year-end 2009 of $22.9 Billion. Reasons for the decline include: fewer card accounts on the books due to recent portfolio purges, and delinquency figures improving through 2010. As you can see, other than 2010, penalty fees in the card business had been on an ever increasing annual climb: 2003: $10.7 B 2004: $11.7 B 2005: $14.8 B 2006: $17.1 B 2007: $18.1 B 2008: $19.0 B 2009: $22.9 B 2010: $22.5 B Company CEO Bob Hammer commented, \u201cIt is important to note that increased consumer costs due to raised APR\u2019s for delinquent accounts (often termed \u201cPenalty Pricing) are not included in the annual Hammer fee income model, as that interest charged is reported in the Interest Income category, not in \u201cNon-Interest\u201d (Fee) Income.\u201d \u201cAlso, as in the past our fee income model broadly includes interchange income, penalty fees, annual fees, cash advance fees/bal. transfer fees, and enhancement income. Penalty fee income is comprised of late fees, over limit fees and other miscellaneous fee income, the vast majority (90%+) are late fees.\u201d \u201cInterest income for decades has clearly been the largest revenue stream for cards, followed by fee income. Those lines have now almost intersected, and are expected to do so in the next 18 \u2013 24 months, with fee income then becoming the largest component of revenue for card issuers. Recent rule changes and regulation impacting interest cards may charge and how interest rate changes may be implemented have hastened issuers\u2019 direction and refocus toward new fees and repricing current fees.\u201d Hammer forecast for 2011: \u201cFee Income rising 9% for credit card companies.\u201d- Formed in 1990, R.K.

    "text": "While the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing, however, the policy prescriptions of the Pain Caucus all have one thing in common: They protect the interests of creditors, no matter the cost. Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work \u2014 but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump \u2014 in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered \u2014 but deflation, not inflation, serves the interests of creditors. And, of course, there\u2019s fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief.\n\nWho are these creditors I\u2019m talking about? Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that it\u2019s all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery.\n\nNo, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios.\n\nAnd that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, it\u2019s the class that has personal access to policy makers \u2014 many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesn\u2019t have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that what\u2019s good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings \u2014 hey, they\u2019re rich, they\u2019re smart, and they have great tailors \u2014 must be good for the economy as a whole.\n\nBut the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy. This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else. And the only way to get a real recovery is to stop playing that game."

    "text": "As Delivered\n\nToday we are asked whether to give the President of the United States authority to use force in Iraq should diplomatic efforts fail to dismantle Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological weapons and his nuclear program.\n\nI am honored to represent nearly 19 million New Yorkers, a thoughtful democracy of voices and opinions who make themselves heard on the great issues of our day especially this one. Many have contacted my office about this resolution, both in support of and in opposition to it, and I am grateful to all who have expressed an opinion.\n\nI also greatly respect the differing opinions within this body. The debate they engender will aid our search for a wise, effective policy. Therefore, on no account should dissent be discouraged or disparaged. It is central to our freedom and to our progress, for on more than one occasion, history has proven our great dissenters to be right.\n\nNow, I believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people, even his own family members, to maintain his iron grip on power. He used chemical weapons on Iraqi Kurds and on Iranians, killing over 20 thousand people. Unfortunately, during the 1980's, while he engaged in such horrific activity, he enjoyed the support of the American government, because he had oil and was seen as a counterweight to the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran.\n\nIn 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, losing the support of the United States. The first President Bush assembled a global coalition, including many Arab states, and threw Saddam out after forty-three days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations. The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge.\n\nAs a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance. And though he repeatedly lied, delayed, and obstructed the inspections work, the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the Gulf War, including thousands of chemical weapons, large volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles and warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bio-weapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities.\n\nIn 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the UN, unwisely in my view, agreed to put limits on inspections of designated \"sovereign sites\" including the so-called presidential palaces, which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by UN resolution to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a result, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an intensive four-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets.\n\nIn 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad.\n\nIn the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001.\n\nIt is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\n\nNow this much is undisputed. The open questions are: what should we do about it? How, when, and with whom?\n\nSome people favor attacking Saddam Hussein now, with any allies we can muster, in the belief that one more round of weapons inspections would not produce the required disarmament, and that deposing Saddam would be a positive good for the Iraqi people and would create the possibility of a secular democratic state in the Middle East, one which could perhaps move the entire region toward democratic reform.\n\nThis view has appeal to some, because it would assure disarmament; because it would right old wrongs after our abandonment of the Shiites and Kurds in 1991, and our support for Saddam Hussein in the 1980's when he was using chemical weapons and terrorizing his people; and because it would give the Iraqi people a chance to build a future in freedom.\n\nHowever, this course is fraught with danger. We and our NATO allies did not depose Mr. Milosevic, who was responsible for more than a quarter of a million people being killed in the 1990s. Instead, by stopping his aggression in Bosnia and Kosovo, and keeping on the tough sanctions, we created the conditions in which his own people threw him out and led to his being in the dock being tried for war crimes as we speak.\n\nIf we were to attack Iraq now, alone or with few allies, it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us. In recent days, Russia has talked of an invasion of Georgia to attack Chechen rebels. India has mentioned the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Pakistan. And what if China were to perceive a threat from Taiwan?\n\nSo Mr. President, for all its appeal, a unilateral attack, while it cannot be ruled out, on the present facts is not a good option.\n\nOthers argue that we should work through the United Nations and should only resort to force if and when the United Nations Security Council approves it. This too has great appeal for different reasons. The UN deserves our support. Whenever possible we should work through it and strengthen it, for it enables the world to share the risks and burdens of global security and when it acts, it confers a legitimacy that increases the likelihood of long-term success. The UN can help lead the world into a new era of global cooperation and the United States should support that goal.\n\nBut there are problems with this approach as well. The United Nations is an organization that is still growing and maturing. It often lacks the cohesion to enforce its own mandates. And when Security Council members use the veto, on occasion, for reasons of narrow-minded interests, it cannot act. In Kosovo, the Russians did not approve NATO military action because of political, ethnic, and religious ties to the Serbs. The United States therefore could not obtain a Security Council resolution in favor of the action necessary to stop the dislocation and ethnic cleansing of more than a million Kosovar Albanians. However, most of the world was with us because there was a genuine emergency with thousands dead and a million driven from their homes. As soon as the American-led conflict was over, Russia joined the peacekeeping effort that is still underway.\n\nIn the case of Iraq, recent comments indicate that one or two Security Council members might never approve force against Saddam Hussein until he has actually used chemical, biological, or God forbid, nuclear weapons.\n\nSo, Mr. President, the question is how do we do our best to both defuse the real threat that Saddam Hussein poses to his people, to the region, including Israel, to the United States, to the world, and at the same time, work to maximize our international support and strengthen the United Nations?\n\nWhile there is no perfect approach to this thorny dilemma, and while people of good faith and high intelligence can reach diametrically opposed conclusions, I believe the best course is to go to the UN for a strong resolution that scraps the 1998 restrictions on inspections and calls for complete, unlimited inspections with cooperation expected and demanded from Iraq. I know that the Administration wants more, including an explicit authorization to use force, but we may not be able to secure that now, perhaps even later. But if we get a clear requirement for unfettered inspections, I believe the authority to use force to enforce that mandate is inherent in the original 1991 UN resolution, as President Clinton recognized when he launched Operation Desert Fox in 1998.\n\nIf we get the resolution that President Bush seeks, and if Saddam complies, disarmament can proceed and the threat can be eliminated. Regime change will, of course, take longer but we must still work for it, nurturing all reasonable forces of opposition.\n\nIf we get the resolution and Saddam does not comply, then we can attack him with far more support and legitimacy than we would have otherwise.\n\nIf we try and fail to get a resolution that simply, but forcefully, calls for Saddam's compliance with unlimited inspections, those who oppose even that will be in an indefensible position. And, we will still have more support and legitimacy than if we insist now on a resolution that includes authorizing military action and other requirements giving some nations superficially legitimate reasons to oppose any Security Council action. They will say we never wanted a resolution at all and that we only support the United Nations when it does exactly what we want.\n\nI believe international support and legitimacy are crucial. After shots are fired and bombs are dropped, not all consequences are predictable. While the military outcome is not in doubt, should we put troops on the ground, there is still the matter of Saddam Hussein's biological and chemical weapons. Today he has maximum incentive not to use them or give them away. If he did either, the world would demand his immediate removal. Once the battle is joined, however, with the outcome certain, he will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and to give what he can't use to terrorists who can torment us with them long after he is gone. We cannot be paralyzed by this possibility, but we would be foolish to ignore it. And according to recent reports, the CIA agrees with this analysis. A world united in sharing the risk at least would make this occurrence less likely and more bearable and would be far more likely to share with us the considerable burden of rebuilding a secure and peaceful post-Saddam Iraq.\n\nPresident Bush's speech in Cincinnati and the changes in policy that have come forth since the Administration began broaching this issue some weeks ago have made my vote easier. Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first and placing highest priority on a simple, clear requirement for unlimited inspections, I will take the President at his word that he will try hard to pass a UN resolution and will seek to avoid war, if at all possible.\n\nBecause bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the United Nations more likely, and therefore, war less likely, and because a good faith effort by the United States, even if it fails, will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause, I have concluded, after careful and serious consideration, that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation. If we were to defeat this resolution or pass it with only a few Democrats, I am concerned that those who want to pretend this problem will go way with delay will oppose any UN resolution calling for unrestricted inspections.\n\nThis is a very difficult vote. This is probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make -- any vote that may lead to war should be hard -- but I cast it with conviction.\n\nAnd perhaps my decision is influenced by my eight years of experience on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in the White House watching my husband deal with serious challenges to our nation. I want this President, or any future President, to be in the strongest possible position to lead our country in the United Nations or in war. Secondly, I want to insure that Saddam Hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the President's efforts to wage America's war against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. And thirdly, I want the men and women in our Armed Forces to know that if they should be called upon to act against Iraq, our country will stand resolutely behind them.\n\nMy vote is not, however, a vote for any new doctrine of pre-emption, or for uni-lateralism, or for the arrogance of American power or purpose -- all of which carry grave dangers for our nation, for the rule of international law and for the peace and security of people throughout the world.\n\nOver eleven years have passed since the UN called on Saddam Hussein to rid himself of weapons of mass destruction as a condition of returning to the world community. Time and time again he has frustrated and denied these conditions. This matter cannot be left hanging forever with consequences we would all live to regret. War can yet be avoided, but our responsibility to global security and to the integrity of United Nations resolutions protecting it cannot. I urge the President to spare no effort to secure a clear, unambiguous demand by the United Nations for unlimited inspections.\n\nAnd finally, on another personal note, I come to this decision from the perspective of a Senator from New York who has seen all too closely the consequences of last year's terrible attacks on our nation. In balancing the risks of action versus inaction, I think New Yorkers who have gone through the fires of hell may be more attuned to the risk of not acting. I know that I am.\n\nSo it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interests of our nation. A vote for it is not a vote to rush to war; it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our President and we say to him - use these powers wisely and as a last resort. And it is a vote that says clearly to Saddam Hussein - this is your last chance - disarm or be disarmed.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n\n\n\n###"

    "text": "On Sunday, former President Bill Clinton \u2014 whose wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, is battling for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination \u2014 fielded some tough questions from four college journalists during mtvU's \"Editorial Board\" in New Orleans. The Clinton installment of \"Editorial Board\" premieres March 26 on mtvU.\n\nWhile the questions were largely expected, Clinton's answers were not. The event \u2014 the first in a televised series that will give selected writers and editors from mtvU's College Media Network the opportunity to meet with some of today's most prominent political figures \u2014 provided Clinton an opportunity to set the record straight.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks he'd made leading up to the South Carolina primary (he pointedly compared Senator Barack Obama's candidacy to that of Jesse Jackson's in '84 and '88, which some perceived as his attempt to pigeonhole his wife's rival as the \"black\" candidate), Clinton said his remarks were blown out of proportion by a media hungry for controversy during election season.\n\n\"Contrary to the myth, I went through South Carolina and never said a bad word about Senator Obama \u2014 not one,\" he insisted. \"I went to African-American college campuses and said, 'Look, I expect most of you are going to vote against Hillary. But I want you to know that she wants your vote.' That's what we did. You can't blame the African-American community for being proud of having a candidate who's immensely impressive, who has had a lot of support in the North among non-African-Americans and has generated all this excitement among young people. I don't think it's rocket science. The fact that people are excited about Senator Obama's candidacy in the African-American community is entirely understandable.\"\n\nBut Clinton warned against approaching this election as though it were a popularity contest. He said while thousands of Americans have rallied around Obama's call for change, his wife has been making change for years.\n\n\"It is almost impossible to find any Democrat who has accomplished more in less time in the Senate \u2014 and with Republicans \u2014 on both domestic and foreign-policy issues and military issues\" than Hillary Clinton, he said. Bill Clinton also said that Obama has been running a campaign that suggests, \"If you were part of making good things happen in the '90s and stopping bad things from happening in this decade ... then you are part of a culture of conflict and you are so yesterday. The only way we can have a good president is to make a completely new beginning.\n\n\"This is the first election in history that I can remember where experience \u2014 and having, actually, experience as a change-maker \u2014 should be a disability for being elected,\" he added. \"All of you who are young have a right to say that, but don't pretend you're not saying that.\"\n\nLater, Clinton took exception to suggestions that Obama has rejected special-interest funds in his campaign. \"[Obama] was the only one who kept his [political action committee],\" Clinton said. \"Then, in the beginning, he spends 40 percent of the PAC money \u2014 43 percent, to be exact \u2014 on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians. Those states constitute 3.7 percent of America's population. He also admitted that his political action committee consulted with his campaign on how to spread the money out. So, therefore, it is not true that he has run a campaign without any special-interest money influencing the presidential campaign.\"\n\nWhen asked why African-Americans' support of his wife continues to drop, Clinton pointed to Obama's caucus win in Iowa as the turning point \u2014 not the comments he made before South Carolina's primary.\n\n\"The minute it became possible that [Obama] could be the nominee, he was going to win the lion's share of the African-American vote,\" Clinton surmised. \"And I think that I never begrudged it.\"\n\nThe issue of drug use was also broached. Clinton famously remarked in the '90s that he had experimented with marijuana but \"never inhaled,\" and Obama has also admitted to trying cocaine as a youth. Clinton was asked whether voters might be swayed by such things from a candidate's past.\n\n\"It was also an issue when President Bush ran for the first time, because he didn't answer the cocaine question, right? ... I think the voters rendered a verdict ... that what you did when you were really young is not going to bar you from serving as president,\" he said.\n\nClinton later told the crowd assembled for Sunday's event that he thinks Congress may abolish the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy regarding gays serving in the military before year's end.\n\n\"It would have been a better policy if it had been implemented the way General [Colin] Powell and I agreed to implement it. ... I think we may have the support now in Congress to get rid of it altogether,\" Clinton said. \"That's what we should do. We should do what every other major country has done and allow gays to serve honorably in the military. ... Our guys came to us and said, 'Look. If you don't agree to this, they're going to bury you. You will have nothing.' \"\n\nGet informed!

His carefully crafted positive image relies on people not knowing this stuff\u2014and you might be surprised by some of it.\n\nPlease check out the list below, and then forward it to your friends, family, and coworkers. We can't rely on the media to tell folks about the real John McCain\u2014but if we all pass this along, we can reach as many people as CNN Headline News does on a good night.\n\nClick here to tell us how many people you can pass it on to\u2014and to see our progress nationally:\n\nhttp://pol.moveon.org/mccain10/\n\n10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't):\n\nJohn McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Now he says his position has \"evolved,\" yet he's continued to oppose key civil rights laws.1 According to Bloomberg News, McCain is more hawkish than Bush on Iraq, Russia and China. Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain \"will make Cheney look like Gandhi.\"2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3\n\nMcCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, \"I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.\"4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a \"second job\" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: \"The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.\"7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his \"spiritual guide,\" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a \"false religion.\" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church \"the Antichrist\" and a \"false cult.\"9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0\u2014yes, zero\u2014from the League of Conservation Voters last year.10\n\nJohn McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be.

It is good to be here. Thank you, Principal Schaeffer, for letting us hold this little assembly here at the high school. (Laughter.) The principal was bragging about both the basketball team and the football team. I understand they\u2019re -- (applause) -- right up there? All right.\n\nThank you, Donna, for the wonderful invitation. We had a chance to visit in the Festas\u2019 living room, and just a wonderful family, and their kids are doing great. So I\u2019m really, really proud to be with all of you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Can you come to my house? (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What did she say? You want -- next time, your house. (Laughter.) All right? (Applause.)\n\nNow, I will say, Donna put out some really good cookies. So -- (laughter) -- I\u2019m just saying. (Laughter.) All right.\n\nNow, I also want to bring greetings from somebody you guys know pretty well -\u2013 a guy named Joe Biden. (Applause.) Joe is in Iraq as we speak, and he\u2019s visiting with our brave men and women in uniform, thanking them for their service. (Applause.) And part of the reason he\u2019s going now is because, pretty soon, we\u2019ll all get a chance to say thank you. This holiday season is going to be a season of homecomings, because by the end of December, all of our troops are going to be out of Iraq. They\u2019re going to be back home. (Applause.)\n\nNow, I mention Joe, first of all, because he loves Scranton. (Applause.) He was born here in Scranton. He spent his early years here in Scranton. This town helped make him who he is. This is a town where he and so many of you grew up with a faith in an America where hard work matters. Where responsibility matters. Where if you stay true to those things, you can get ahead. Where no matter who you are, no matter what you look like -\u2013 whether you own a factory or you work on the factory floor \u2013- America is a place where you can make it if you try. (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s why Joe and I ran for this office. You are why we spent so much time in this state a few years ago. Because even then, those ideas -\u2013 the idea that\u2019s at the very heart of the American Dream \u2013- felt like it was slipping away for a lot of people. It was wonderful visiting with Patrick and Donna, and we were talking about the fact that Patrick has been -- Patrick Festa has been teaching in the school system for 25 years now; Donna has been a graphic artist. But they\u2019re still worried about if the washer/dryer goes out, or if they have to do a car repair. Things are tight. And they\u2019re pretty lucky that they\u2019ve got a good job, steady jobs. For a lot of folks, it\u2019s a lot tougher.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve gone through a difficult decade for middle-class Americans. More good jobs in manufacturing left our shores over the last decade. More of our prosperity was built on risky financial deals and homes that a lot of folks couldn\u2019t afford. And a lot of you watched your incomes fall or your wages flatline. Meanwhile, the costs of everything from college to health care were all going up. And then, after all that, the financial crisis hit because of the irresponsibility of some on Wall Street. (Applause.) And that made things a whole lot tougher.\n\nToday, we all know folks who\u2019ve spent months looking for work. We all know families making deep sacrifices just to get by. We all know young people who have gone to college, they\u2019ve taken on a bunch of debt. Now they\u2019re finding that the opportunity that they worked so hard to find is getting harder and harder to come by. So there\u2019s a sense of deep frustration among people who\u2019ve done the right thing, but don\u2019t see that hard work and that responsibility pay off. And that\u2019s not the way things are supposed to be, not here in America.\n\nBut here today with all of you, I\u2019m thinking about something that is probably Joe\u2019s favorite expression. And some of you know Joe\u2019s story. He went through some tough times when he was a kid. And his father used to tell him, Champ, when you get knocked down, you get up. You get up.\n\nAnd Scranton, we\u2019ve taken some punches these last few years. But there\u2019s one thing I know about people here in Scranton, people in Pennsylvania, and people all across America: We are tougher than the times. We are America. We get back up. We fight back. We move forward. (Applause.) We don\u2019t give up. We get back up. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd even though our economic problems weren\u2019t caused overnight and so they\u2019re not going to be solved overnight -- even though it\u2019s going to take a few more years to meet all the challenges that were decades in the making -- we\u2019re fighting to make things right again. We\u2019re fighting to make sure that if you are working hard and you are carrying out your responsibilities and you\u2019re looking out for your family, that you can live a good, solid, middle-class life. That is what America is all about. And we are going to be fighting for that every day, every week, every month and every year that we\u2019re in office. (Applause.)\n\nWe want an America where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded. We\u2019re fighting to rebuild an economy that restores security for the middle class and renews opportunity for folks that are trying to get into the middle class. We\u2019re fighting to build an economy that\u2019s not based on outsourcing and tax loopholes and risky financial schemes, but one that\u2019s built to last -- one where we invest in things like education and small businesses -- (applause) -- an economy that\u2019s built on manufacturing and building things again and selling them all around the world. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to keep fighting to make our economy stronger and put our friends and neighbors back to work, to give our young people opportunities greater than the opportunities that we had. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for the last three years.\n\nBut two months ago, I sent a particular piece of legislation to Congress called the American Jobs Act. (Applause.) This is a jobs bill that will put more Americans to work, put more money back in the pockets of working families. It\u2019s contains ideas that historically have been supported by Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share. (Applause.) And independent economists said that it would create up to 2 million jobs, and grow the economy by as much as 2 percent. And that\u2019s what we need right now.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the problem -- there is a problem. Folks in Washington don\u2019t seem to be getting the message. When this jobs bill came to a vote, Republicans in the Senate got together and they blocked it. They refused to even debate it. Even though polls showed that two-thirds of Americans of all political stripes supported the ideas in this bill, not one single Republican stepped up to say, this is the right thing to do.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Not one. But here\u2019s the good news, Scranton. Just like you don\u2019t quit, I don\u2019t quit. (Applause.) I don\u2019t quit. So I said, look, I\u2019m going to do everything that I can do without Congress to get things done. (Applause.)\n\nSo let\u2019s just take a look over the past several weeks. We said, we can\u2019t wait. We just went ahead and started taking some steps on our own to give working Americans a leg up in a tough economy. For homeowners, I announced a new policy that will help families refinance their mortgages and save thousands of dollars. (Applause.) For all the young people out here -- (applause) -- we reformed our student loan process to make it easier for more students to pay off their debts earlier. (Applause.) For our veterans out here -- and I see some veterans in the crowd -- (applause) -- we ordered several new initiatives to help our returning heroes find new jobs and get trained for those jobs. (Applause.) Because you shouldn\u2019t have to fight for a job when you come home after fighting for America -- you shouldn\u2019t have to do that. (Applause.)\n\nAnd in fact, last week I was able to sign into law two new tax breaks for businesses that hire veterans, because nobody out here who is a veteran should -- we have to make sure that they are getting the help that they need.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Mr. President!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And by the way, I think we\u2019re starting to get, maybe, to the Republicans a little bit, because they actually voted for this veterans bill. I was glad to see that. (Applause.) I was glad that Democrats and Republicans got together with this bipartisan legislation.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a lot more to do, though, if we\u2019re going to get every American back to work who wants to work, and to rebuild an economy that works for every American, which is why we\u2019re going to give Congress another chance to do the right thing with the American Job Act. We\u2019re going to give them another chance to help working families like yours. (Applause.)\n\nLast year, both parties came together to cut payroll taxes for the typical household by $1,000. Now, that\u2019s been showing up in your paychecks each week. You may not be aware of it, because times are tight. But you actually got a tax cut of $1,000 this year. Now, I know you hear a lot of folks on cable TV claiming that I\u2019m this big tax-and-spend liberal. Next time you hear that, you just remind the people who are saying it that since I\u2019ve taken office, I\u2019ve cut your taxes. (Applause.)\n\nYour taxes today -- the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office, just remember that. (Applause.) We have cut taxes for small businesses not once, not twice, but 17 times. The average family\u2019s tax burden is among the lowest it\u2019s been in the last 60 years.\n\nSo the problem is not that we\u2019ve been raising taxes. We\u2019ve actually been trying to give families a break during these tough times. But here\u2019s the thing: That payroll tax cut that we passed in December of last year, it\u2019s set to expire at the end of this year, one month from now. If that happens -- if Congress doesn\u2019t act to extend this tax cut -- then most of you, the typical middle-class family, is going to see your taxes go up by $1,000 at the worst possible time. A young lady just said she can\u2019t afford that. It would be tough for you. It would also be a massive blow for the economy, because we\u2019re not fully out of the recession yet. Don\u2019t take my word for it; this is what every independent economist says. We can\u2019t let this tax cut lapse right now.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why my jobs bill -- part of the American Jobs Act was to extend this tax cut for another year. In fact, it does one better. It says, let\u2019s expand that tax cut. Instead of a $1,000 tax cut next year, the typical working family under my plan would get a tax cut of $1,500. (Applause.) Instead of it coming out of your paycheck, it would be going into your pocket. Now, that\u2019s money that you can spend on a small business right here in Scranton. If you\u2019re a small business owner, my jobs bill will cut your payroll taxes in half. So if you\u2019ve got 50 employees making $50,000 each, you\u2019d get a tax cut of nearly $80,000. That\u2019s money that you can then use to hire some more workers and get this economy moving again. That\u2019s a good thing. (Applause.)\n\nNow, this really should not be controversial. A lot of Republicans have agreed with this tax cut in the past. The Republican leader in the Senate said it would -- I\u2019m quoting here -- it would \u201cput a lot of money back in the hands of business and in the hands of individuals.\u201d That\u2019s what he said. Another Republican leader said it would help small business owners create jobs and help their employees spend more money, creating even more jobs. One Republican even called it a \u201cconservative approach to help put our economy back on track.\u201d So what\u2019s the problem?\n\nThe bad news is some of those same Republicans voted \u201cno\u201d on my jobs bill and those tax cuts. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s just because I proposed it. I don\u2019t know. They said \u201cno\u201d to cutting taxes for small business owners and working families. One of them said just two years ago that this kind of tax cut would boost job creation, and now that I\u2019m proposing it, he said we should let it expire. I mean, what happened?\n\nRepublicans say they\u2019re the party of tax cuts. That\u2019s what they say. A lot of them have sworn an oath to never raise taxes on anybody as long as they live. That doesn\u2019t square with their vote against these tax cuts. I mean, how is it that they can break their oath when it comes to raising your taxes, but not break their oath when it comes to raising taxes for wealthy people? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. (Applause.) I mean, I hope that they don\u2019t want to just score political points. I hope that they want to help the economy.\n\nThis cannot be about who wins and loses in Washington. This is about delivering a win for the American people. That\u2019s what this is about. (Applause.) You know, $1,500 -- that\u2019s not a Band-Aid for middle-class families, that\u2019s a big deal. How many people here could use an extra $1,500? (Applause.) Yes, I thought so.\n\nSo I\u2019ll tell you what, Scranton. They may have voted \u201cno\u201d on these tax cuts once. But I\u2019m already filled with the Christmas spirit. There\u2019s kind of some chill in the air. I saw some Christmas decorations at the Festas. So I\u2019m in a Christmas spirit. I want to give them another chance. I want to give them a chance to redeem themselves. We\u2019re going to give them another chance.\n\nSo as early as Friday, this Friday, in a couple of days, we\u2019re going to give them a chance to take a simple vote on these tax cuts. If they vote \u201cno,\u201d then the typical family\u2019s taxes will go up by $1,000 next year. If they vote \u201cyes,\u201d then the typical family will have an extra $1,500 in their pocket. (Applause.) So let\u2019s just be clear: If they vote \u201cno,\u201d your taxes go up; vote \u201cyes,\u201d you get a tax cut. Which way do you think Congress should vote? They should vote \u201cyes,\u201d it\u2019s pretty simple.\n\n\n\nNow, if you want to see what this vote will mean for your bottom line, we have this spiffy new tax calculator on our Internet site, WhiteHouse.gov. So you can go on there and you can punch in your numbers and figure out what it would mean to your family. But this is real money that would go into the economy at a time it needs it.\n\nNow, I really do think your voices are already getting\n\nthrough, because some of the folks in Congress are starting to say, well, maybe we\u2019re open to this thing. Maybe we\u2019ll be open to these tax cuts. And that\u2019s good news. But I want to make sure that we do this responsibly. So what I\u2019ve said is, to pay for this tax cut, we need to ask wealthy Americans to pay their fair share. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re asking -- what we\u2019ve said is let\u2019s ask the folks who\u2019ve seen their incomes rise fastest, who\u2019ve gotten bigger tax breaks under Bush, let\u2019s ask them to help out a little bit, because they made it better through the recession than most of us. Let\u2019s ask them to contribute a little bit more to get the economy going again.\n\nAnd I just want to point out I\u2019ve done pretty well over these last few years. So I\u2019ve said, let me pay a little bit more. I promise you, I can afford it. (Laughter.) I really can. We\u2019re asking people like me to sacrifice just a little bit so that you guys have a little bit of a leg up.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, let me say this: When you talk to most folks who are making a million dollars a year, they are willing to do more if they\u2019re asked. Warren Buffett is a good example. They\u2019re willing to do more if they\u2019re asked. (Applause.)\n\nNow, I mean, I don\u2019t want to exaggerate. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re volunteering. (Laughter.) But if they\u2019re asked, if they feel like it\u2019s going to help middle-class families, help grow the economy, help to reduce the deficit, they\u2019re willing to help. I can\u2019t tell you how many well-to-do folks I meet who say, look, America gave me a chance to succeed. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a good education. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a college scholarship. Somewhere along the line, somebody built the information and transportation networks that have helped my business grow. Somewhere along the line, somebody gave me a shot. And so now it\u2019s my turn to do the next generation that same good thing. I\u2019ve got to give something back to them as well. (Applause.)\n\nBecause, Scranton, this is something everybody in this audience understands. When you think about the history of Scranton and the immigrants who came here and worked hard, each successive generation doing a little bit better -- you guys know that what America is about is that we\u2019re all in this together; that each of us has to do our own individual part, but we also have to be looking out for one another.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the very simple choice that\u2019s facing Congress right now: Are you going to cut taxes for the middle class and those who are trying to get into the middle class? Or are you going to protect massive tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, many of whom don\u2019t even want those tax breaks? Are you going to ask a few hundred thousand people who have done very, very well to do their fair share? Or are you going to raise taxes for hundreds of millions of people across the country -- 160 million Americans? Are you willing to fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are most fortunate? What\u2019s it going to be?\n\nThat\u2019s the choice in front of Congress. And I hope members of Congress think hard about this, because their actions lately don\u2019t reflect who we are as a people. What does it say about our priorities when we\u2019d rather protect a few really well-to-do people than fight for the jobs of teachers and firefighters? (Applause.) What does it say when we -- about our values when we\u2019d rather fight for corporate tax breaks than put construction workers back on the job rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools? (Applause.) What does it say about us if we\u2019re willing to cut taxes for the people who don\u2019t need them, and raise them on folks who do need a tax break?\n\nWe are better than that. America is better than that. We celebrate individual achievement, we expect everybody to work hard, but we don\u2019t believe in every person for themselves; we believe that out of many, we come together as one. (Applause.) We\u2019re a people who reach for our own success, but we also reach back for the people -- to bring somebody up. Reach back to help others earn their own success as well. (Applause.) And we believe that if the folks at the bottom and the folks in the middle succeed, then American succeeds, and the folks at the top succeed as well. (Applause.)\n\nThe decisions we make today are going to determine whether or not our kids grow up in a country where those values still thrive. And Scranton, I don\u2019t know about you, but I want our kids to grow up -- I want Malia and Sasha and all your kids, I want them to come into a country that is built on those big, generous values -- (applause) -- an America that reflects the values that we inherited from our parents and our grandparents.\n\nSo if you agree with me, I need you to tell Congress where your priorities lie. Members of Congress, they work for you. Scranton, you\u2019ve got a great senator in Senator Casey. I love Senator Casey. (Applause.)\n\nSo I want you to know, Casey is already on the program. (Applause.) But to everybody who is here, everybody who is watching, send your Senate a message -- send your senators a message. Tell them, \u201cDon\u2019t be a Grinch.\u201d (Laughter.) \u201cDon\u2019t be a Grinch.\u201d Don\u2019t vote to raise taxes on working Americans during the holidays. Make sure to renew unemployment insurance during the holidays. (Applause.) Stop saying \u201cno\u201d to steps that would make our economy stronger. Put our country before party. Put money back into the pockets of working Americans. Do your job. Pass this bill. (Applause.)\n\nScranton, the American people are with us on this. It is time for folks to stop running around spending all their time talking about what\u2019s wrong with America. Spend some time, roll up your sleeves, and help us rebuild America. That\u2019s what we need to do. (Applause.)\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this country that we can\u2019t fix. We\u2019re Americans, and our story has never been about things coming easy to us. That\u2019s not what Scranton has been about. That\u2019s not what Pennsylvania, that\u2019s not what America is about. It\u2019s been about rising to the moment, and meeting the moment when things are hard. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right.\n\nSo let\u2019s do what\u2019s right. Let\u2019s prove that the best days of America are still ahead of us.\n\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n3:03 P.M. EST"

    "text": "Rick Santorum: By amending constitution, we can balance the budget for good\n\nBy RICK SANTORUM\n\nLast summer, we saw a great groundswell of national support to get our fiscal house in order by cutting and capping federal spending and passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. However, the President refused to lead and instead pushed the tough decisions to a bureaucratic Washington committee to solve the problem, and though it was named the 'Supercommittee' it couldn't even agree on cutting Post-It Notes from the office supply closet. Now, because of the inaction, we are faced with drastic defense cuts at a time when reports show a nuclear Iran has emerged as a clear and present danger.I supported the 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' movement, but the reality is that what we really need is 'Balance, Balance, Grow' - because without a balanced budget amendment, and a path to economic prosperity, we cannot ever trust the government to actively try and balance the federal budget.Both parties can talk all they want about fiscal responsibility, but passing a balanced budget amendment that requires a supermajority for any tax increase and puts a cap on federal spending at 18 percent of GDP is the only way to permanently ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means.Currently, government spending has exploded to nearly 25 percent of GDP and is well on its way to 40 percent. This is unacceptable and must be stopped.Yes, we should cut spending now, but our ultimate goal is to shrink the size and scope of the federal government forever, and passing a balanced budget amendment will permanently cap spending and ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means.This cornerstone of my economic policy ultimately empowers the American family and builds economic freedom.A balanced budget amendment is a long-term, permanent fix to over-spending, and it would not be a 'draconian' method because it would not happen overnight. The process to pass and ratify a constitutional amendment will take six to eight years. That not only gives our government time to put our budget on a glide-path to fiscal responsibility, but it sets a deadline for our representatives to get the job done.The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work. The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding 'no' vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals.Passing a balanced budget amendment will also force our government to address the entitlement crisis crippling our economy. For years, every member of Congress has been afraid of touching entitlements because it is considered the 'third rail of politics.' But with the passage of the balanced budget amendment, we'll be forced to address this crucial piece of the fiscal puzzle. I know that we can make the tough choices necessary to restructure and save those programs because we've done it before. In 1996, I led the fight to reform the welfare system, ending dependency for millions and providing them with avenues to get back to work. I led that fight and got conservative results despite opposition from a popular President, Bill Clinton, who vetoed the bill twice.And finally, we must implement policies to immediately grow our economy, and this starts with revitalizing our manufacturing sector, which can be the great multiplier on our economy. Yes, we must make more things in America again, but first, we must create an environment that breeds more opportunity here at home. We must eliminate the corporate tax for manufacturers, eliminate all Obama-era regulations that cost business more than $100 million a year, and eliminate the excise tax on overseas profits when those revenues are reinvested in American plants and equipment. We must also make sure the government is not in the way of energy production, and instead increase all forms of energy exploration: whether oil, natural gas, coal, etc. We must reduce the cost of energy across the board for everyone who goes to the pump to fill up their automobile and for the manufacturing plant that produces the automobile itself. This will jump-start our economy, broaden our tax base and, most importantly, rebuild the great middle of our society that has been lost along with our manufacturing jobs over the past 40 years.You can trust my commitment to getting this economy going again, and together we can finish the job we came so close to completing: passing a balanced budget amendment, which is the only way to keep our budget under control for good.\n\n\n\nColumn Presidential Guest Commentary"

    "text": "Of all the major Republicans, the one who comes closest to my worldview is Newt Gingrich. Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility.\n\nAs he said in 2007, \u201cIt\u2019s not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.\u201d\n\nLook at American history, Gingrich continued, \u201cThe government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country. The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it. We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation. All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies.\u201d\n\nThis was not one of Gingrich\u2019s passing fads. It is one of the most consistent themes of his career. His 1984 book, \u201cWindow of Opportunity,\u201d is a broadside against what he calls the \u201claissez-faire\u201d conservatism \u2014 the idea that government should just get out of the way so the market can flourish. As he wrote, \u201cThe opportunity society calls not for a laissez-faire society in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but for forceful government intervention on behalf of growth and opportunity.\u201d"

    "text": "Births: Preliminary Data for 2005\n\nby Brady E. Hamilton, Ph.D.; Joyce A. Martin, M.P.H.; and Stephanie J. Ventura, M.A. Division of Vital Statistics\n\nThis report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) summarizes 2005 preliminary births and birth rates and selected 2005 preliminary maternal and infant health birth data for the United States. The findings come from a substantial portion of the records of births (99.2 percent) that occurred in calendar year 2005 and were received and processed by NCHS as of May 31, 2006. A report that includes both these demographic and health characteristics of births as well as state-based preliminary 2005 data is in preparation ( 1 ).\n\nResults from Preliminary Birth Data, 2005\n\nBirths and birth rates\n\nKey findings, illustrated in Tables 1-3, 5-8 , and Figures 1-3 , show:\n\nThe number of births and the general fertility rate (GFR) increased slightly, whereas the crude birth rate remained unchanged from 2004 to 2005. The preliminary estimate of births in 2005, 4,140,419, increased 1 percent from 2004 ( Tables 1 , 5 , 6 , and 8 ) ( 2 ). Births rose for Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Asian or Pacific Islander (API), and non-Hispanic black women, but declined slightly for non-Hispanic white women. The crude birth rate in 2005 was 14.0 births per 1,000 total population, unchanged from 2004. The preliminary 2005 GFR (66.7 births per 1,000 women age 15-44 years), however, rose slightly from 2004, to the highest level since 1993 ( 2 ). The GFR rose for Hispanic and AIAN women, declined slightly for API women, and was essentially unchanged for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women.\n\nThe birth rate for teenagers declined 2 percent in 2005, falling to 40.4 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years, a 35-percent drop compared with the most recent peak in 1991 (61.8), and the lowest ever recorded in the 65 years for which a consistent series of rates is available ( Tables 2 , 5 , 7 , and Figures 1 and 2 ) ( 3 ).\n\nThe decline was concentrated among teenagers aged 15-17 years, for whom the birth rate fell 3 percent, to 21.4 births per 1,000, another record low for the Nation. The rate for this age group has dropped 45 percent since 1991 (38.6).\n\nThe rate for older teenagers, 18-19 years, essentially stable at 69.9 births per 1,000 according to preliminary data for 2005, was 26 percent lower than in 1991 (94.0). The birth rate for the youngest teenage group, 10-14 years, was unchanged in 2005, at 0.7 births per 1,000 females.\n\nAmong race and Hispanic origin subgroups, birth rates fell 3 percent each for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black teenagers 15-19 years. The decline for young non-Hispanic black teenagers 15-17 years was 6 percent for 2004-2005 and 59 percent since 1991, the steepest reduction overall by race or age group.\n\nBirths to women in their early twenties increased slightly. The birth rate for women aged 20\u201324 years rose to 102.2 births per 1,000 women in 2005, less than 1 percent over the rate in 2004. The rate for women aged 25\u201329 years, the highest rate amongst the age groups, was essentially unchanged in 2005 (115.6) ( Tables 5 and 7 ).\n\nChildbearing by women in their thirties and forties continued to increase. The birth rate for women aged 30\u201334 years rose slightly between 2004 and 2005, to 95.9 births per 1,000, the highest rate since 1964. The rate for women aged 35-39 years rose to 46.3 births per 1,000, 2 percent over the rate in 2004 and the highest rate since 1965 [ 2 , 3 ]. The birth rate for women 40\u201344 years also rose by 2 percent, to 9.1, the highest rate since 1968, and the rate for women aged 45\u201349 years increased slightly, to 0.6 births per 1,000 women, the first increase in the rate since 2000 and the highest rate for this age group since 1970 ( Tables 5 and 7 ).\n\n\n\nAmong race and Hispanic origin groups, the rates for women aged 30-34 years increased for Hispanic and non-Hispanic black women (about 2 percent each) and decreased for API women (about 2 percent). The rates for non-Hispanic white and AIAN women were essentially unchanged in 2005. Rates for women aged 35-39 years increased by 2 percent for women in each of the three largest groups (non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic blacks). The rates for the remaining groups were essentially unchanged.\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) rose slightly in 2005 to 2,054.0, compared with 2,045.5 in 2004 ( Table 1 ) ( 2 ). The TFR summarizes the potential impact of current fertility patterns on completed family size to estimate the average number of births that a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their lifetimes. The total fertility rate by race and Hispanic origin increased significantly in 2005 for only Hispanic women (2 percent), and decreased significantly for only non-Hispanic white women (less than 1 percent) ( Table 1 ). Rates for non-Hispanic black, AIAN, and API women were essentially unchanged between 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe first birth rate for women aged 15-44 years was 26.5 births per 1,000, a slight increase over the rate in 2004 ( Table 7 ). The first birth rates for women aged 20-24 and 35-39 years increased between 2004 and 2005 by 2 and 1 percent, respectively, whereas rates for women aged 15-19, 25-29, and 30-34 years decreased by 1 to 2 percent. Rates for women 40 years of age and over were unchanged.\n\nCrude birth rates (CBR) vary considerably among states ranging, in 2005, from 10.4 births per 1,000 total population in Vermont to 20.9 in Utah ( Table 8 ). There were generally only small changes in the birth rates for most states in 2005 compared with 2004; rates in 10 states declined significantly (Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Utah) and rates in 7 states (Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wyoming) increased significantly.\n\n\n\nFertility rates also vary considerably among states, ranging from 51.0 births per 1,000 women age 15-44 years in Vermont to 90.4 in Utah (see Table 8 ). General fertility rates for most states changed relatively little between 2004 and 2005, like the CBR, however, rates for 16 states increased significantly (Alabama, California, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming), whereas rates for 3 states (Louisiana, New York, and Utah) decreased significantly.\n\nAll measures of childbearing by unmarried women increased to record levels for the Nation in 2005 according to preliminary data ( 2 , 4 ). The total number of births rose 4 percent to 1,525,345, compared with 1,470,189 in 2004. During 2002-2005, the number increased 12 percent overall.\n\nThe birth rate increased 3 percent in 2005 to 47.6 per 1,000 unmarried women aged 15-44 years, up from 46.1 in 2004.\n\nThe proportion of births to unmarried women increased in 2005 to 36.8 percent, compared with 35.8 percent in 2004. The proportions increased for all population subgroups by race and Hispanic origin ( Table 1 and Figure 3 ).\n\nIn 2005, well over four in five births to teenagers were nonmarital ( Table 3 ). Over one-half of births to women aged 20-24 years and nearly 3 in 10 births to women aged 25-29 years were to unmarried women.\n\nMaternal and Infant Health Birth Characteristics\n\nKey findings, illustrated in Table 4 and Figures 4 and 5 , show:\n\nThe preliminary rate of cesarean delivery rose 4 percent in 2005 to 30.2 percent of all births, another record high for the Nation ( Table 4 ). The cesarean rate declined somewhat during the early and mid-1990s, but has risen 46 percent since 1996 (from 20.7 percent). Rates were up in 2005 for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, AIAN, API, and Hispanic women, and also for each 5-year age group. Since 1996, rates have risen by more than 40 percent for all age groups, including for young women under 20 years of age (see Figure 4 ). (For information on trends for 1989 to 2004 in primary cesarean deliveries and vaginal births after a previous cesarean, see \u201cBirths: Final Data for 2004\u201d ( 2 ).)\n\nThe preterm birth rate rose from 12.5 to 12.7 percent for 2004-2005 (see Figure 5 ). The percentage of infants delivered at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation has risen 20 percent since 1990 (from 10.6 percent) ( 2 ). Preterm rates rose significantly for non-Hispanic white (11.7 percent for 2005), non-Hispanic black (18.4 percent) and Hispanic infants (12.1 percent) between 2004 and 2005. Rates for non-Hispanic white and Hispanic births have been rising for more than a decade, increasing 38 percent for non-Hispanic white, and 10 percent for Hispanic infants since 1990. The preterm rate for black infants declined modestly during the 1990s, but has been on the rise since the year 2000. Although the upswing in multiple births has had an important influence on recent trends in preterm birth rates, shorter gestations have also risen among singleton deliveries ( 2 ).\n\nThe proportion of all infants born very preterm (less than 32 completed weeks of gestation) rose very slightly between 2004 and 2005 (from 2.01 to 2.03 percent). Late preterm births (34-36 weeks) increased more markedly, from 8.9 to 9.1 percent for the same period. No significant change was observed in the percentage of 32-33 week births. Much of the upturn in the preterm rate over recent years can be attributed to increases in late preterm births ( 2 ), Figure 5 . Although at lower risk than those born at earlier gestational ages, infants delivered late preterm are at greater risk of compromised pregnancy outcome than those born later in pregnancy ( 5 , 6 ).\n\nThe percentage of infants born low birthweight also increased in 2005, to 8.2 percent of all births, from 8.1 percent in 2004 ( Table 4 ). The percentage of infants born low birthweight (less than 2,500 grams) has increased more than 20 percent since the mid-1980s (from 6.7) ( 2 ); the 2005 level is the highest level reported since 1968 ( 7 ). Low birthweight rates rose 1 to 2 percent for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic infants between 2004 and 2005. Among all births, levels of both very low (less than 1,500 grams), and moderately low birthweight (1,500-2,499 grams) increased slightly for the current year.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The data for 2005 are based on a continuous receipt and processing of statistical records through May 31, 2006, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS receives the data from the states\u2019 vital registration systems through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. In this report, U.S. totals include only events occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Detailed information on reporting completeness and imputation procedures may be found in the \u201cTechnical Appendix\u201d of Vital Statistics of the United States, 2004, Natality (8).\n\nTo produce the preliminary estimates shown in this report, records in the file were weighted using independent control counts of all 2005 births by state of occurrence. Detailed information on weighting is available elsewhere (8). Detailed information on the reliability of estimates also may be found elsewhere (1).\n\nThe 1989 and 2003 U.S. Standard Certificates of Live Birth\n\nThis report includes selected 2005 data on items that are collected on both the 1989 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (unrevised) and 2003 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (revised). The 2003 revision is described in detail elsewhere (2,9-11). Twelve states and one U.S. territory (Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York State (excluding New York City), Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington) implemented the revised certificate as of January 1, 2005. One additional state, Vermont, implemented the revised birth certificate in 2005, but after January 1. These 13 states represent 30.8 percent of all 2005 births; the 12 states that implemented as of January 1, 2005, represent 30.6 percent of all births.\n\nHispanic origin and race\n\nHispanic origin\n\nRace and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the birth certificate. Data shown by race (i.e., American Indian or Alaska Native and Asian or Pacific Islander) include persons of Hispanic or non-Hispanic origin, and data for Hispanic origin include persons of any race. Data shown for Hispanic persons include all persons of Hispanic origin of any race. Data are shown separately for non-Hispanic white women because there are substantial differences in childbearing patterns between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women.\n\nSingle, multiple, and \u201cbridged\u201d race\n\nThe 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth allows the reporting of more than one race (multiple races) for each parent (9). Information on this change is presented in a recent report (2).\n\nIn 2005, multiple race was reported by Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York State (excluding New York City), Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont (for births occurring from July 1, 2005, only), and Washington, which used the 2003 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, as well as, California, Hawaii, Michigan (for births at selected facilities only), Ohio, Utah, and Minnesota, which used the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth. In addition, multiple race was also reported by Puerto Rico. Data from the vital records of the remaining 31 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia are based on the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth that follows the 1977 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standard, allowing only a single race to be reported (11-13).\n\nIn order to provide uniformity and comparability of the data during the transition period, before all or most of the data are available in the new multiple race format, it was necessary to \u201cbridge\u201d the responses of those who reported more than one race (multiple race) to one, single race (see \u201cPopulation denominators\u201d). Information on the processing and tabulation of data by race is presented in a recent report (2)\n\nMarital status\n\nNational estimates of births to unmarried women are based on two methods of determining marital status. For 2004 and 2005, birth certificates in 48 states and the District of Columbia included a direct question about mother\u2019s marital status; in two of these states, California and Nevada, a direct question is part of the electronic birth registration process but does not appear on certified or paper copies of the birth certificate. The question in most states is: \u201cMother married? (At birth, conception, or any time between) (Yes or no)\u201d. Marital status is inferred in Michigan and New York. A birth is inferred as nonmarital if a paternity acknowledgment was filed or if the father\u2019s name is missing from the birth certificate (listed in respective priority-of-use order).\n\nPopulation denominators\n\nBirth and fertility rates for 2005 shown in this report are based on population estimates based on the 2000 census, as of July 1, 2005. These population estimates are available on the NCHS Web- page (14). The production of these population estimates is described in detail in a recent report (2).\n\nInformation on the national estimates of births to unmarried women (i.e., methods of determining marital status) and the computation of the preliminary birth rates for unmarried women is presented elsewhere (1). The birth rate for unmarried women for 2005 is estimated on the basis of population distributions by marital status provided by the U.S. Census Bureau as of March 2005 applied to the national population estimates as of July 1 (4,14,15). Both population files are 2000 census based. The nonmarital birth rate shown here for 2005 thus differs from those published by NCHS in the annual final reports, which are based on populations estimated from 3-year averages of the marital status distributions, rather than a single year as shown here (4). Population estimates for a single year are not an adequate basis for computing age-specific birth rates for unmarried women\u2014these rates are available only in reports based on final data.\n\nSuggested citation\n\nHamilton BE, Martin JA, Ventura SJ.

    "text": "Rose Garden\n\n11:00 A.M. EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Everybody, please have a seat. Sorry we\u2019re running just a little bit behind, but I figured it\u2019s a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden.\n\nToday, members of Congress have a simple choice to make: They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people.\n\nRight now, the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits \u2013- profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station. But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- billions a year in taxpayer subsidies -\u2013 a subsidy that they\u2019ve enjoyed year after year for the last century.\n\nThink about that. It\u2019s like hitting the American people twice. You\u2019re already paying a premium at the pump right now. And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if these companies can\u2019t stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour. And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companies\u2019 profits. In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits. Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because we\u2019re giving them billions in tax giveaways every year.\n\nNow, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy. We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well. We want them to succeed. That\u2019s why under my administration, we\u2019ve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production. We\u2019ve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. We\u2019ve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. And just yesterday, we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic.\n\nSo the fact is, we\u2019re producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and we\u2019re importing less of it as well. For two years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home -\u2013 for the first time in over a decade.\n\nSo American oil is booming. The oil industry is doing just fine. With record profits and rising production, I\u2019m not worried about the big oil companies. With high oil prices around the world, they\u2019ve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank. And I think it\u2019s curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies.\n\nInstead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry that\u2019s never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising -- investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and buildings. That\u2019s the future. That\u2019s the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year. As the economy is growing, the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly. That\u2019s not the kind of pattern that we want to be in. We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs.\n\nAnd keep in mind, we can\u2019t just drill our way out of this problem. As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up. Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil but we only have 2 percent of the world\u2019s known oil reserves. And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but we\u2019d still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference. We\u2019d still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs. And because it\u2019s a world market, the fact that we\u2019re doing more here in the United States doesn\u2019t necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies they\u2019re selling that oil on a worldwide market. They\u2019re not keeping it just for us. And that means that if there\u2019s rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up.\n\nThat\u2019s not the future that I want for America. I don\u2019t want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that there\u2019s some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether there\u2019s going to be enough supply. I don\u2019t want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world.\n\nI want us to control our own destiny. I want us to forge our own future. And that\u2019s why, as long as I\u2019m President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way. But it also means that we\u2019re going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America.\n\nWe\u2019re going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power that\u2019s already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs. We\u2019re going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week. We\u2019re going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that you\u2019re in charge of your own energy bills.\n\nWe\u2019re going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource: American ingenuity and American imagination. That\u2019s what we need to keep going. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake right now. That\u2019s the choice that we face. And that\u2019s the choice that\u2019s facing Congress today. They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that aren\u2019t needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nAnd as long as I\u2019m President, I\u2019m betting on the future. And as the people I\u2019ve talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well. That\u2019s what we do as Americans. That\u2019s who we are. We innovate. We discover. We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges. And, ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed. And I believe that we\u2019re going to do that again. Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n11:08 A.M. EDT"

Lately, I\u2019ve been speaking a lot about our need for an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy -- a strategy that produces more oil and gas here at home, but also produces more biofuels and fuel-efficient cars, more solar power and wind power and other sources of clean, renewable energy.\n\nThis strategy is not just the right thing to do for our long-term economic growth; it\u2019s also the right way for us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil right now. It\u2019s the right way for us to put people to work right now. And ultimately, it\u2019s the right way to stop spikes in gas prices that we\u2019ve put up [with] every single year -- the same kind of increase that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of months.\n\nObviously rising gas prices means a rough ride for a lot of families. Whether you\u2019re trying to get to school, trying to get to work, do some grocery shopping, you have to be able to fill up that gas tank. And there are families in certain parts of the country that have no choice but to drive 50 or 60 miles to get to the job. So when gas prices go up, it\u2019s like an additional tax that comes right out of your pocket.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year and made sure it extended all the way through this year, so that the average American is getting that extra $40 in every paycheck right now.\n\nBut I think everybody understands that there are no quick fixes to this problem. There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more then gas prices would come down right away. What they don\u2019t say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. We\u2019ve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some.\n\nBut as I've said repeatedly, the problem is we use more than 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil and we only have 2 percent of the world\u2019s proven oil reserves. Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, we\u2019d still have to rely disproportionately on other countries for their oil. That means we pay more at the pump every time there\u2019s instability in the Middle East, or growing demand in countries like China and India.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now. It\u2019s those global trends that are affecting gas prices. So even as we're tackling issues of supply and demand, even as we're looking at the long-term in terms of how we can structurally make ourselves less reliant on foreign oil, we still need to work extra hard to protect consumers from factors that should not affect the price of a barrel of oil.\n\nThat includes doing everything we can to ensure that an irresponsible few aren\u2019t able to hurt consumers by illegally manipulating or rigging the energy markets for their own gain. We can't afford a situation where speculators artificially manipulate markets by buying up oil, creating the perception of a shortage, and driving prices higher -- only to flip the oil for a quick profit. We can\u2019t afford a situation where some speculators can reap millions, while millions of American families get the short end of the stick. That\u2019s not the way the market should work. And for anyone who thinks this cannot happen, just think back to how Enron traders manipulated the price of electricity to reap huge profits at everybody else\u2019s expense.\n\nNow, the good news is my administration has already taken several actions to step up oversight of oil markets and close dangerous loopholes that were allowing some traders to operate in the shadows.\n\nWe closed the so-called Enron loophole that let traders evade oversight by using electronic or overseas trading platforms. In the Wall Street reform law, we said for the first time that federal regulators will make sure no single trader can buy such a large position in oil that they could easily manipulate the market on their own. So I\u2019d point out that anybody who\u2019s pledging to roll back Wall Street reform -- Dodd-Frank -- would also roll back this vital consumer protection along with it.\n\nI\u2019ve asked Attorney General Holder to work with Chairman Leibowitz of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other enforcement agencies to make sure that acts of manipulation, fraud or other illegal activity are not behind increases in the price that consumers pay at the pump.\n\nSo today, we\u2019re announcing new steps to strengthen oversight of energy markets. Things that we can do administratively, we are doing. And I call on Congress to pass a package of measures to crack down on illegal activity and hold accountable those who manipulate the market for private gain at the expense of millions of working families. And be specific.\n\nFirst, Congress should provide immediate funding to put more cops on the beat to monitor activity in energy markets. This funding would also upgrade technology so that our surveillance and enforcement officers aren\u2019t hamstrung by older and less sophisticated tools than the ones that traders are using. We should strengthen protections for American consumers, not gut them. And these markets have expanded significantly.\n\nChairman Gensler actually had a good analogy. He said, imagine if the NFL quadrupled the number of teams but didn\u2019t increase the number of refs. You\u2019d end up having havoc on the field, and it would diminish the game. It wouldn\u2019t be fair. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on in a lot of these markets. So we have to properly resource enforcement.\n\nSecond, Congress should increase the civil and criminal penalties for illegal energy market manipulation and other illegal activities. So my plan would toughen key financial penalties tenfold, and impose these penalties not just per violation, but for every day a violation occurs.\n\nThird, Congress should give the agency responsible for overseeing oil markets new authority to protect against volatility and excess speculation by making sure that traders can post appropriate margins, which simply means that they actually have the money to make good on their trades.\n\nCongress should do all of this right away. A few weeks ago, Congress had a chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump; congressional Republicans voted to keep spending billions of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies. So here's a chance to make amends, a chance to actually do something that will protect consumers by increasing oversight of energy markets. That should be something that everybody, no matter their party, should agree with. And I hope Americans will ask their members of Congress to step up.\n\nIn the meantime, my administration will take new executive actions to better analyze and investigate trading activities in energy markets and more quickly implement the tough consumer protections under Wall Street reform.\n\nLet me close by saying none of these steps by themselves will bring gas prices down overnight. But it will prevent market manipulation and make sure we're looking out for American consumers. And in the meantime we're going to keep pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy to break the cycle of price spikes year after year. We are going to keep producing more biofuels; we're going to keep producing more fuel-efficient cars; we are going to keep tapping into every source of American-made energy.\n\nAnd these steps have already helped put America on a path to greater energy independence. Our foreign -- our dependence on foreign oil has actually decreased each year I've been in office -- even as the economy has grown. America now imports less than half of the oil we use for the first time in more than a decade. So we are less vulnerable than we were, but we're still too vulnerable.\n\nWe've got to continue the hard, sustained work on this issue. And as long as I'm President we're going to keep placing our bets on America's future -- America's workers, America's technology, America's ingenuity, and American-made energy. That's how we're going to solve this problem once and for all.\n\nThank you very much, everybody.\n\nEND\n\n11:35 A.M. EDT"

    "text": "So, this is very, very important, that this is a two-year period so that people can apply. And it allows our law enforcement officials to focus on criminals who really posed a threat and ought to be the focus here. But the only permanent way to fix our immigration system, certainly to provide a permanently relief for DREAM Act eligible populations is for Congress to act.\n\nWALLACE: You mentioned Governor Romney. I don't to get into the whole thing about the differences will get to the economy in a minute. But specifically for Hispanic voters, do you think there's a clear choice between Obama and Romney?\n\nPLOUFFE: I think there's a clear choice for everybody.\n\nWALLACE: Well, I'm asking about Hispanics.\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, first of all --\n\nWALLACE: On this issue of immigration.\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, first of all, Hispanic voters highly support the health care bill, what we're trying to do in education. On immigration, yes, this is a president who's tried to get immigration done in a comprehensive way. We're getting close to getting the DREAM Act done.\n\nSo, this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants. And that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that. Governor Romney has said he would veto the DREAM Act. Governor Romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home. They ought to self deport.\n\nSo, this is someone you're not going to be able to trust. And this one of the important choices that the president talked about earlier this week in Ohio. President Romney if he's elected is not going to fix our immigration system. He's been very clear about that. You watch Republican debate after Republican debate, many of them on your network, where Governor Romney was very clear, he would veto the DREAM Act. He thinks these 11 million people ought to just be sent home.\n\nSo, I think that's a clear choice just not for the Latino community, but for the American electorate at large.\n\nWALLACE: All right. Let's turn to the economy. The president gave a major economic speech this week in Ohio in which he called for targeted investments for things like energy and education and state workers, first responders and teachers, and tax hikes for the wealthy. But there was -- forgive me -- nothing new.\n\nIs that the president's agenda for the next four years -- pass the jobs plan that I have been pushing for over the last 12 months and that will fix the economy?\n\nPLOUFFE: What the president laid out is a clear choice facing the American people. And the contrast could not be clear. This is a president who believes we need to grow the economy by putting the middle class first, creating middle class jobs, by reducing the deficit in a fair or balanced way, and making sure we can invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and science and research.\n\nThe congressional Republican approach, Governor Romney's approach -- by the way, it's fitting, he's with John Boehner today -- because Governor Romney is going to rubber stamp the Republican agenda, which basically gives huge tax cuts for the wealthy. They believe the economy works best from the top down. That's failed.\n\nBy the way, Governor Romney wouldn't reduce the deficit. Every independent economists who's looked at this plan says he would add to the deficit, he would starve investment in education, he would allow infrastructure to deteriorate even more. This is not a recipe for growing the economy, reducing the deficit or helping the middle class. So, that's the stark choice --\n\nWALLACE: Does the president's agenda -- because I did not hear anything new in Ohio -- is the president's agenda for the next four years more of the same?\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, what it is, is what this country needs to do, which is reduce the deficit in a right way, fair and balanced way.\n\nWALLACE: I like the fact that you keep saying fair and balanced.\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, it's the right way, which is we need to cut more spending. This president has already signed into law, by the way, over -- almost $2 trillion on spending cuts. We have to focus on what is going to grow this economy for the middle class. And that's going to be continuing to focus on our manufacturing --\n\nWALLACE: But you would agree, there is no new agenda beyond what he is pushing for the last year?\n\nPLOUFFE: This is the direction he thinks that the country needs to go.\n\nNow, let's look at the other direction, it failed miserably. When Governor Romney led Massachusetts, number one debt in the country -- think about that. Added debt. For all of this talk about government, for every private sector job created in Massachusetts by Governor Romney, six public sector jobs.\n\nThis is someone who -- his state was 47 in job creation. And he wants to return to the same policies that led to the great recession that, you know, caused a huge harm to our businesses, our economy and people in this country.\n\nSo, the choice is clear here.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nPLOUFFE: The choice is clear.\n\nWALLACE: I have a couple of minutes left and I want to get to these campaign questions. You were the Obama campaign manager in 2008. I ask about whether there's anything new, because you are taking hits right now -- you, the campaign -- from some notable Democrats like James Carville and Bill Clinton, who are saying that you need to stop talking about the progress we've made and start talking about a new agenda, how things in the next four years are going to be different than they were in the last one.\n\nAre they wrong?\n\nPLOUFFE: First of all, President Clinton, he's appeared with President Obama. He said very clearly that we are beginning to grow again. We're beginning to make progress. We can't return to the same policy.\n\nPresident Clinton is someone knows something about reducing the deficit, about creating jobs, and he's been very clear -- he thinks Mitt Romney would be a disaster for this country.\n\nSo, listen, those other Democrats aren't paying attention to what the president said, which is everyday, not just on what he said, but what he does -- he understands our economy is not strong as it needs to be, that this didn't happen overnight, it's going to take us a long time to recover, there's a lot of people out there hurting.\n\nSo, we are making progress. We need to make a lot of more. That's very clear.\n\nWALLACE: But you said, just a few months ago, that trajectory in the economy is going well. We had fewer and fewer jobs, each of the last four months. GDP growth is 1.9 percent, 69,000 jobs, the lowest in the year created. The trajectory is not going like this anymore, sir. It's going like this.\n\nPLOUFFE: Well, compared to where we were in recession we had over 4 million jobs created over the last 26 months. We had that private sector jobs --\n\nWALLACE: But you've got three and a half years to fix it. PLOUFFE: Well, listen, this is a deep hole caused by the same policies Mitt Romney wants to go back to. This is what folks need to focus on. We just went through recession.\n\nRemarkably, what Mitt Romney and the congressional Republicans want to do is, hey, I guess that worked out well. Let's go back to the same rules. Let Wall Street writes its own rules, make it easier to polluters to foul our air more, huge tax cuts to people like Mitt Romney and basically paid for by raising taxes on working Americans, and making it harder for people to get education, not believing in the new energy future, not rebuilding this country.\n\nSo, listen, this is a tough recession we are recovering from. We are making slow and steady progress. Nobody is satisfied. The president most of all knows we have to recover more quickly, create jobs more quickly. But the choice is, are we going to continue and move forward -- are we going to go back to the same policies that caused the recession?\n\nWALLACE: I got it. One last question --\n\nPLOUFFE: It's important. Nothing is more important than this, Chris.\n\nWALLACE: One more question real quickly, any chance you'll leave the White House, go back to Chicago and run this campaign."

    "text": "Updated: ASPEN \u2014 Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.\n\nThey gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.\n\nAnd at a fund-raising event earlier in the day \u2014 one of three \u2013he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I relish and that\u2019s what I like,\u2019\u2019 he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is \u201cabout the size of Senator Obama\u2019s foreign-policy team.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nMany on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.\n\nMr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, \u201cthe first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cThis is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, \u201cI have to be against the tax increases, as you know,\u201d and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it\u2019s closer to $5 a gallon.\n\nAt one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his \u201cmaverick\u201d stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?\n\nIn a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the \u201cChristian right.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush\u2019s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.\n\nAs for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a \u201ctraitor,\u201d Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.\n\nHe said he himself had been called \u201cdisloyal\u201d by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn\u2019t work. He said he had been \u201cdeclared dead,\u201d but he was reminded of Chairman Mao\u2019s saying that \u201cit\u2019s always darkest before it\u2019s totally black.\u201d But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, \u201che voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.\u201d He added: \u201cI think he\u2019s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,\u201d he said, to sustained applause.\n\nHe also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, \u201cwe passed up an opportunity\u201d to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.\n\nHe also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cThe kind of war they\u2019re fighting requires long-term commitment,\u201d he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.\n\nOn the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA\u2019s \u201cDancing Queen\u201d was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin.\u201d\n\nHe said that if he\u2019s \u201clacking in anything,\u201d it is an appreciation for music and art and \u201cthe other great things in life,\u201d partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.\n\n\u201cEverybody says, \u2018I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.\u2019How come everybody goes to \u2018Mamma Mia!?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody goes! They\u2019ve been selling out for years.\u201d\n\nAfter another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.\n\n\u201cI appreciate art,\u201d he declared. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m going to do and I have the opportunity, it\u2019s to take a class in art.\u201d He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, \u201cbut some of the things weren\u2019t there that I would like to see.\u201d\n\nHe then added, \u201cBut I make no excuses for my taste in music.\u201d"

    "text": "During a private fundraiser earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told a small group of wealthy contributors what he truly thinks of all the voters who support President Barack Obama. He dismissed these Americans as freeloaders who pay no taxes, who don\u2019t assume responsibility for their lives, and who think government should take care of them. Fielding a question from a donor about how he could triumph in November, Romney replied:\n\nThere are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that\u2019s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what\u2026These are people who pay no income tax.\n\nRomney went on: \u201c[M]y job is is not to worry about those people. I\u2019ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d\n\nMother Jones has obtained video of Romney at this intimate fundraiser\u2014where he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in public\u2014and has confirmed its authenticity. To protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after Romney had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. [UPDATE: We can now report that this fundraiser was held at the Boca Raton home of controversial private equity manager Marc Leder on May 17, and we\u2019ve removed the blurring from the video. See the original blurred videos here.]\n\nHere is Romney expressing his disdain for Americans who back the president:\n\nAt the dinner, Romney often stuck to familiar talking points. But there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines. Describing his family background, he quipped about his father, \u201cHad he been born of Mexican parents, I\u2019d have a better shot of winning this.\u201d Contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, Romney insisted, \u201cI have inherited nothing.\u201d He remarked, \u201cThere is a perception, \u2018Oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth.\u2019 Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America.\u201d\n\nRomney told the contributors that \u201cwomen are open to supporting me,\u201d but that \u201cwe are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, we\u2019re in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.\u201d When one attendee asked how this group could help Romney sell himself to others, he answered, \u201cFrankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.\u201d He added, \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m either tied or close to the president\u2026that\u2019s very interesting.\u201d\n\nAsked why he wouldn\u2019t go full-throttle and assail Obama as corrupt, Romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for Obama in 2008:\n\nWe speak with voters across the country about their perceptions. Those people I told you\u2014the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our side\u2014they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So, and by the way, when you say to them, \u201cDo you think Barack Obama is a failure?\u201d they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, \u201cAre you disappointed that his policies haven\u2019t worked?\u201d they say yes. And because they voted for him, they don\u2019t want to be told that they were wrong, that he\u2019s a bad guy, that he did bad things, that he\u2019s corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasn\u2019t up to the task. They love the phrase that he\u2019s \u201cover his head.\u201d But if we\u2019re\u2014but we, but you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans. We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and don\u2019t agree with us. And so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them. And the best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he\u2019d keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn\u2019t been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can\u2019t get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won\u2019t graduate from high school. What\u2019re they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, \u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d What he\u2019s going to do, by the way, is try and vilify me as someone who\u2019s been successful, or who\u2019s, you know, closed businesses or laid people off, and is an evil bad guy. And that may work.\n\n(Note: Obama did not promise his policies would keep unemployment under 8 percent, and 50 percent of college graduates are not unemployed.)\n\nTo assure the donors that he and his campaign knew what they were doing, Romney boasted about the consultants he had retained, emphasizing that several had worked for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:\n\nI have a very good team of extraordinarily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particular who have done races around the world. I didn\u2019t realize it. These guys in the US\u2014the Karl Rove equivalents\u2014they do races all over the world: in Armenia, in Africa, in Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his race. So they do these races and they see which ads work, and which processes work best, and we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. I\u2019d tell them to you, but I\u2019d have to shoot you.\n\nWhen one donor said he was disappointed that Romney wasn\u2019t attacking Obama with sufficient intellectual firepower, Romney groused that the campaign trail was no place for high-minded and detail-oriented arguments:\n\nWell, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country, and people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I don\u2019t think this will have a significant impact on my electability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impact\u2026My dad used to say, \u201cBeing right early is not good in politics.\u201d And in a setting like this, a highly intellectual subject\u2014discussion on a whole series of important topics typically doesn\u2019t win elections. And there are, there are, there are\u2014for instance, this president won because of \u201chope and change.\u201d\n\nRomney, who spoke confidently throughout the event and seemed quite at ease with the well-heeled group, insisted that his election in and of itself would lead to economic growth and that the markets would react favorably if his chances seemed good in the fall:\n\nThey\u2019ll probably be looking at what the polls are saying. If it looks like I\u2019m going to win, the markets will be happy. If it looks like the president\u2019s going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy. It depends of course which markets you\u2019re talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is that if we win on November 6th, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country. We\u2019ll see capital come back and we\u2019ll see\u2014without actually doing anything\u2014we\u2019ll actually get a boost in the economy. If the president gets reelected, I don\u2019t know what will happen. I can\u2014I can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my own view is that if we get a \u201cTaxageddon,\u201d as they call it, January 1st, with this president, and with a Congress that can\u2019t work together, it\u2019s\u2014it really is frightening.\n\nAdvertise on MotherJones.com\n\nAt the dinner, Romney also said that the campaign purposefully was using Ann Romney \u201csparingly\u2026so that people don\u2019t get tired of her.\u201d And he noted that he had turned down an invitation from Saturday Night Live because such an appearance \u201chas the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential.\u201d\n\nHere was Romney raw and unplugged\u2014sort of unscripted. With this crowd of fellow millionaires, he apparently felt free to utter what he really believes and would never dare say out in the open. He displayed a high degree of disgust for nearly half of his fellow citizens, lumping all Obama voters into a mass of shiftless moochers who don\u2019t contribute much, if anything, to society, and he indicated that he viewed the election as a battle between strivers (such as himself and the donors before him) and parasitic free-riders who lack character, fortitude, and initiative. Yet Romney explained to his patrons that he could not speak such harsh words about Obama in public, lest he insult those independent voters who sided with Obama in 2008 and whom he desperately needs in this election. These were sentiments not to be shared with the voters; it was inside information, available only to the select few who had paid for the privilege of experiencing the real Romney.\n\nALSO READ: More from the secret Romney video.

    "text": "The candidates wives were in attendance for the most highly anticipated campaign event to date.\n\nThe presidential race has been dominated so far by negative advertising as both camps try to frame the election to their advantage.\n\nThe first of three presidential debates focused on domestic issues: the economy, health care and the role of government.\n\nRomney, who has been unable to catch the president in most polls to date, sought to generate enthusiasm for a change in the White House.\n\nRomney said Obama has failed to bring down high unemployment and get the economy surging again.\n\nJim Leher of PBS moderates the 90-minute debate on Wednesday. It was the candidates' first time debating face to face.\n\n(CNN) \u2014\n\nThe following is a transcript of Wednesday night\u2019s presidential debate in Denver.\n\n21:01:40: JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. I\u2019m Jim Lehrer of the \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.\n\nThis debate and the next three \u2013 two presidential, one vice presidential \u2013 are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight\u2019s 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.\n\nThousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.\n\nThe segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.\n\nThe audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent \u2013 no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. Let\u2019s start the economy, segment one, and let\u2019s begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?\n\nYou have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.\n\n21:04:24: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.\n\nThere are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.\n\nAnd so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up.\n\nAnd because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\u2019ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.\n\nBut we all know that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\u2019ve been, but where we\u2019re going.\n\nGovernor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\u2019ll be better off. I\u2019ve got a different view.\n\nI think we\u2019ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\u2019s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\u2019re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\u2019re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.\n\nNow, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters \u2013 to you \u2013 which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I\u2019m looking forward to having that debate.\n\n21: 06:31: LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.\n\n21:06:32: FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It\u2019s an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. I\u2019m pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.\n\nAnd congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I\u2019m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here \u2013 here with me. So I\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCongratulations.\n\nThis is obviously a very tender topic. I\u2019ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\u201d\n\nAnn yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \u201cAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\u2019s lost his most recent job and we\u2019ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\u201d\n\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\u2019s going to take a different path. Not the one we\u2019ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do.\n\nMy plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs.\n\nNumber two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.\n\nNumber three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\u2019re far away from that now.\n\nNumber four, get to us a balanced budget.\n\nNumber five, champion small business. It\u2019s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.\n\nNow, I\u2019m concerned that the path that we\u2019re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more \u2013 if you will, trickle-down government \u2013 would work.\n\nThat\u2019s not the right answer for America. I\u2019ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.\n\n21:08:40: LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down \u2013 his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.\n\n21:08:50: OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.\n\nSo now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.\n\nWhen it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.\n\nOn energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.\n\nSo all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?\n\nAnd this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2013 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2013 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2013 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.\n\n21:11:03: LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we\u2019re going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.\n\nBut, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you\u2019d like to ask the president directly about something he just said?\n\n21:11:03: ROMNEY: Well, sure. I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am.\n\nThe people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2013 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing.\n\nAt the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.\n\nAnd so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2013 the cornerstones of my plan.\n\nBut the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.\n\nThe second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.\n\nThe third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies.\n\nMr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2013 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada.\n\nAnd, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.\n\nAnd finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2013 the revenues going to the government. My \u2013 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.\n\nBut I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2013 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2013 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:14:22: OBAMA: Well, I think \u2013 let\u2019s talk about taxes, because I think it\u2019s instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.\n\nAnd the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who\u2019s going off to college, which means they\u2019re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.\n\nNow, Governor Romney\u2019s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he\u2019s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn\u2019t been able to identify them.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to make an important point here, Jim.\n\n21:16:34: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:16:36: OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can \u2013 are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don\u2019t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.\n\nOBAMA: And that\u2019s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney\u2019s pledge of not reducing the deficit or \u2013 or \u2013 or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not my analysis. That\u2019s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And \u2013 and that kind of top \u2013 top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that\u2019s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.\n\n21:16:37: LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? Let\u2019s just stay on taxes.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Just \u2013 let\u2019s just stay on taxes for (inaudible).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: What is the difference\u2026\n\n21:16:42: ROMNEY: Well, but \u2013 but virtually \u2013 virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.\n\n21:16:43: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:16:44: ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I\u2019d say absolutely not. I\u2019m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I\u2019ve said is I won\u2019t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That\u2019s part one. So there\u2019s no economist that can say Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.\n\nNumber two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it\u2019s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it\u2019s just not the case. Look, I\u2019ve got five boys. I\u2019m used to people saying something that\u2019s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I\u2019ll believe it. But that \u2013 that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.\n\nAnd number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it\u2019s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you\u2019re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.\n\nThere are all these studies out there. But let\u2019s get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you\u2019d think, well, then why lower the rates.\n\nAnd the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America\u2019s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:18:30: LEHRER: That\u2019s where we started. Yeah.\n\nDo you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?\n\n21:18:34: OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he\u2019s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d\n\nAnd the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic.\n\nNow, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2013 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.\n\nBut I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.\n\nAnd the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.\n\nAnd we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2013 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened.\n\nBut under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2013 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income.\n\nAnd that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.\n\n21:21:01: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:21:03: ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that \u2013 on that point, which is these\u2026\n\n21:21:04: LEHRER: Just for the \u2013 just for record\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:21:07: ROMNEY: \u2026 the small businesses we\u2019re talking about\u2026\n\n21:21:09: LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we\u2019re way over our first 15 minutes.\n\n21:21:10: ROMNEY: It\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\n\n21:21:11: LEHRER: It\u2019s OK, it\u2019s great. No problem. Well, you all don\u2019t have \u2013 you don\u2019t have a problem, I don\u2019t have a problem, because we\u2019re still on the economy. We\u2019re going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.\n\nOK, but go ahead, sir.\n\n21:21:38: ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, you\u2019re \u2013 Mr. President, you\u2019re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not \u2013 not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they\u2019re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half \u2013 half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.\n\nNow, and \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. He\u2019s in the electronics business in \u2013 in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there\u2019s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That\u2019s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.\n\n21:22:58: OBAMA: Jim, I \u2013 you may want to move onto another topic, but I \u2013 I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion \u2013 just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that\u2019s more than our entire defense budget \u2013 and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney\u2019s plan may work for you.\n\nBut I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that\u2019s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we\u2019ve tried this. We\u2019ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney\u2019s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBill Clinton tried the approach that I\u2019m talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we\u2019ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they\u2019ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we\u2019re not blowing up the deficit.\n\n21:24:40: ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:24:42: LEHRER: Well, you\u2019re going to get the first word in the next segment.\n\n21:24:48: ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:24:50: ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me \u2013 let me repeat \u2013 let me repeat what I said. I\u2019m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That\u2019s not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That\u2019s point one.\n\nSo you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that\u2019s not my plan.\n\nNumber two, let\u2019s look at history. My plan is not like anything that\u2019s been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.\n\nMy priority is putting people back to work in America. They\u2019re suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It\u2019s absolutely extraordinary. We\u2019ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.\n\nGoing forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.\n\n21:26:01: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s talk \u2013 we\u2019re still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt.\n\nAnd the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you \u2013 you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?\n\n21:26:31: ROMNEY: Good. I\u2019m glad you raised that, and it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a critical issue. I think it\u2019s not just an economic issue, I think it\u2019s a moral issue. I think it\u2019s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they\u2019re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.\n\nAnd the amount of debt we\u2019re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.\n\nSo how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they\u2019re paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.\n\nThe presidents would \u2013 president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.\n\nWhat things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don\u2019t pass it: Is the program so critical it\u2019s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I\u2019ll get rid of it. Obamacare\u2019s on my list.\n\nI apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.\n\nOBAMA: I like it.\n\nROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So I\u2019ll get rid of that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Jim, I\u2019m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I\u2019m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, I\u2019ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.\n\nNumber three, I\u2019ll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.\n\nThis is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.\n\nThe president said he\u2019d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The president\u2019s put it in place as much public debt \u2013 almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.\n\n21:28:35: LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.\n\n21:28:37: OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.\n\nAnd despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.\n\nSo 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, 18 government \u2013 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.\n\nAnd I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nNow, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.\n\nAnd the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2013 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.\n\nLet \u2013 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no.\n\nNow, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:31:15: OBAMA: \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.\n\n21:31:22: LEHRER: Mr. President, I\u2019m sorry.\n\n21:31:26: OBAMA: And \u2013 and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.\n\n21:31:28: LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.\n\n21:31:28: OBAMA: Sorry.\n\n21:31:34: LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n21:31:34: ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.\n\n21:31:35: LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n21:31:36: ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It\u2019s not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.\n\n21:31:48: OBAMA: That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we\u2019re putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But you\u2019ve been \u2013 but you\u2019ve been president four years\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:31:54: ROMNEY: You\u2019ve been president four years. You said you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. It\u2019s now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we\u2019ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you\u2019re re-elected, we\u2019ll get to a trillion-dollar debt.\n\nI mean, you have said before you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. And this \u2013 I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn\u2019t get the job done.\n\nLet me come back and say, why is it that I don\u2019t want to raise taxes? Why don\u2019t I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we\u2019re in recession, you shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone.\u201d\n\nWell, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don\u2019t want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it\u2019s not just wealthy people \u2013 you mentioned Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just Donald Trump you\u2019re taxing. It\u2019s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.\n\nYou raise taxes and you kill jobs. That\u2019s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don\u2019t want to kill jobs in this environment.\n\nI\u2019ll make one more point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:21: LEHRER: (inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment.\n\n21:33:22: ROMNEY: OK.\n\n21:33:23: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:33:24: OBAMA: Well, we\u2019ve had this discussion before.\n\n21:33:26: LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.\n\n21:33:30: OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He\u2019s ruled out revenue.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:31: ROMNEY: Absolutely. (CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:30: ROMNEY: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That\u2019s how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you\u2019ll never get there. You\u2019ll never balance the budget by raising taxes.\n\nSpain \u2013 Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We\u2019re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don\u2019t want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they\u2019re working.\n\n21:34:11: LEHRER: But \u2013 but Mr. President, you\u2019re saying in order to \u2013 to get the job done, it\u2019s got to be balanced. You\u2019ve got to have\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:34:16: OBAMA: If \u2013 if we\u2019re serious, we\u2019ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.\n\nThe oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get.\n\nNow, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.\n\nWhen it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2013 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2013 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.\n\nWell, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\n\nRight now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue.\n\nAnd so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.\n\nIt means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2013 she\u2019s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are 10 years old.\n\nThat is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices.\n\nUltimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.\n\nAnd the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.\n\nAs I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a 30 \u2013 a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.\n\nNow, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem.\n\nAnd governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.\n\n21:37:19: ROMNEY: Jim, let\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve gone on a lot of topics there, and so it\u2019s going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools\u2026\n\n21:37:22: LEHRER: Come back to\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:37:25: ROMNEY: \u2026 to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let\u2019s go through them one by one.\n\nFirst of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it\u2019s actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that\u2019s been in place for a hundred years. Now\u2026\n\nOBAMA: It\u2019s time to end it.\n\nROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.\n\nNow, I like green energy as well, but that\u2019s about 50 years\u2019 worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.\n\nBut, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years\u2019 worth of breaks, into \u2013 into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don\u2019t just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this \u2013 this is not \u2013 this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.\n\nThe second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I\u2019ve been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.\n\nLEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But \u2013 but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting where I\u2019d like to bring money from overseas back to this country.\n\nAnd, finally, Medicaid to states? I\u2019m not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you\u2019re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you\u2019re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.\n\nAnd I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors \u2013 Republican and Democrats \u2013 said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.\n\nSo \u2013 so let\u2019s state \u2013 one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don\u2019t have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this.\n\nAnd, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.\n\n21:39:49: LEHRER: Let\u2019s go.\n\n21:39:48: ROMNEY: But \u2013 but the right \u2013 the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.\n\n21:39:52: LEHRER: (inaudible) and we\u2019re going on \u2013 still on the economy, on another \u2013 but another part of it\u2026\n\nOBAMA: OK.\n\n21:39:56: LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First \u2013 first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?\n\n21:40:15: OBAMA: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we\u2019ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It\u2019s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker \u2013 Democratic Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill. But it is \u2013 the basic structure is sound.\n\nBut \u2013 but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that\u2019s the big driver of our deficits right now.\n\nYou know, my grandmother \u2013 some of you know \u2013 helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice.\n\nAnd the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the perspective I bring when I think about what\u2019s called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who\u2019ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.\n\nSo my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\u2019re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let\u2019s look where some of the money\u2019s going.\n\n$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\u2019t overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a \u2013 make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the \u2013 throughout the system.\n\nSo the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don\u2019t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.\n\n21:42:38: LEHRER: We\u2019ll follow up on this.\n\nFirst, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.\n\n21:42:41: ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something\u2019s going to happen that\u2019s going to change their life for the worse.\n\nAnd the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you\u2019re 60 or around 60 or older, you don\u2019t need to listen any further.\n\nBut for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\u2019t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\u2019s not.\n\nBut on Medicare, for current retirees, he\u2019s cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s saying we\u2019re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\u2019t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.\n\nWe also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients.\n\nThis \u2013 we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.\n\nNow, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $1 \u2013 that\u2019s $1 for every $15 you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade.\n\nI want to take that $716 billion you\u2019ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.\n\nBut the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.\n\nAnd with regards to young people coming along, I\u2019ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.\n\n21:44:43: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:44:44: OBAMA: First of all, I think it\u2019s important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.\n\nAnd the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It\u2019s called premium support, but it\u2019s understood to be a voucher program. His running mate\u2026\n\n21:45:05: LEHRER: And you don\u2019t support that?\n\n21:45:07: OBAMA: I don\u2019t. And let me explain why.\n\n21:45:08: ROMNEY: Again, that\u2019s for future\u2026\n\n21:45:09: OBAMA: I understand.\n\n21:45:10: ROMNEY: \u2026 people, right, not for current retirees.\n\n21:45:12: OBAMA: For \u2013 so if you\u2019re \u2013 if you\u2019re 54 or 55, you might want to listen \u2018cause this \u2013 this will affect you.\n\nThe idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.\n\nThe problem is that because the voucher wouldn\u2019t necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.\n\nNow, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he\u2019ll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there\u2019s still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what\u2019ll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.\n\nAnd then what you\u2019ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own \u2013 only my opinion. AARP thinks that the \u2013 the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \u201cObamacare,\u201d if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They\u2019re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.\n\nAnd the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren\u2019t making seniors any healthier. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.\n\n21:47:21: LEHRER: We\u2019ll talk about \u2013 specifically about health care in a moment. But what \u2013 do you support the voucher system, Governor?\n\n21:47:27: ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.\n\n21:47:32: LEHRER: And what about the vouchers?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:47:36: ROMNEY: So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice.\n\nThey get to choose \u2013 and they\u2019ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don\u2019t have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That\u2019s not going to happen. They\u2019ll have at least two plans.\n\nAnd by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they\u2019ll be able to get a private plan.\n\nI know my own view is I\u2019d rather have a private plan. I\u2019d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I\u2019d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don\u2019t like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice.\n\nThe other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we\u2019re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That\u2019s the plan that I\u2019ve put forward.\n\nAnd, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or \u2013 or Senator Wyden, who\u2019s the co-author of the bill with \u2013 with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. This is an idea that\u2019s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.\n\n21:49:05: OBAMA: Jim, if I \u2013 if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.\n\nAnd private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s what they do. And so you\u2019ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\u2019s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.\n\nAnd when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they\u2019re stuck.\n\nAnd this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that\u2019s why they were supportive of the approach that we took.\n\nOne last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid\u2026 LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.\n\nOBAMA: \u2026 but \u2013 but \u2013 but overall.\n\nLEHRER: OK.\n\nOBAMA: And so\u2026\n\nROMNEY: That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a big topic. Can we \u2013 can we stay on Medicare?\n\nOBAMA: Is that a \u2013 is that a separate topic?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Yeah, we\u2019re going to \u2013 yeah, I want to get to it.\n\nOBAMA: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nLEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 before we leave the economy\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:50:20: ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.\n\n21:50:25: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:50:27: ROMNEY: If that\u2019s the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.\n\n21:50:30: LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.\n\n21:50:32: ROMNEY: But my experience \u2013 my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.\n\n21:50:38: LEHRER: All right. Can we \u2013 can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice \u2013 a clear choice between the two\u2026\n\n21:50:40: ROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 of you on Medicare?\n\nROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n21:50:42: LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there \u2013 should there be more?\n\nBeginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we\u2019ll go for a few minutes, and then we\u2019re going to go to health care, OK?\n\n21:51:07: ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can\u2019t have a free market work if you don\u2019t have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have \u2013 I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn\u2019t have people opening up banks in their \u2013 in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.\n\n21:51:30: LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?\n\n21:51:31: ROMNEY: In some places, yes. Other places, no.\n\n21:51:32: LEHRER: Like where?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:51:37: ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. And what\u2019s happened with some of the legislation that\u2019s been passed during the president\u2019s term, you\u2019ve seen regulation become excessive, and it\u2019s hurt \u2013 it\u2019s hurt the economy. Let me give you an example.\n\nDodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they\u2019re effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that\u2019s been given to \u2013 to New York banks I\u2019ve ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There\u2019ve been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.\n\nSo there\u2019s one example. Here\u2019s another. In Dodd-Frank\u2026\n\n21:52:15: LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank?\n\n21:52:17: ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We\u2019re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for\u2026\n\n21:52:25: LEHRER: Well, here\u2019s a specific\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:52:28: ROMNEY: But let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s mention \u2013 let me mention the other one. Let\u2019s talk\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:52:33: LEHRER: No, let\u2019s not. Let\u2019s let him respond \u2013 let\u2019s let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.\n\n21:52:41: OBAMA: I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.\n\nNow, it wasn\u2019t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were \u2013 that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn\u2019t have been given, because the folks didn\u2019t qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\u2019t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren\u2019t.\n\nBut you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\u2019t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.\n\nSo what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you\u2019ve got \u2013 banks, you\u2019ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can\u2019t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We\u2019ve going to make sure that you\u2019ve got to have a living will so \u2013 so we can know how you\u2019re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don\u2019t have other taxpayer bailouts.\n\nIn the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.\n\nNow, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.\n\nAnd, you know, I appreciate and it appears we\u2019ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.\n\nAnd so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that\u2019s not what I believe.\n\n21:54:42: ROMNEY: Sorry, but that\u2019s just not \u2013 that\u2019s just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That\u2019s why I\u2019d have regulation. But I wouldn\u2019t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That\u2019s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn\u2019t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it\u2019s killing regional and small banks. They\u2019re getting hurt.\n\nLet me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren\u2019t qualified. That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that\u2019s not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn\u2019t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years. We don\u2019t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It\u2019s hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It\u2019s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn\u2019t come out with a clear regulation.\n\nI will make sure we don\u2019t hurt the functioning of our \u2013 of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.\n\n21:55:55: LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, let\u2019s move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it\u2019s a two-minute new \u2013 new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.\n\nYou want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?\n\n21:56:20: ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can\u2019t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we\u2019re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can\u2019t afford it.\n\nAnd the number of small businesses I\u2019ve gone to that are saying they\u2019re dropping insurance because they can\u2019t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And \u2013 and we\u2019ve got to deal with cost.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, when \u2013 when \u2013 when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it\u2019s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it\u2019s gone up by that amount. So it\u2019s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t want it.\n\nSecond reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.\n\nNumber three, it puts in place an unelected board that\u2019s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don\u2019t like that idea.\n\nFourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what\u2019s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don\u2019t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the \u2013 at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.\n\nAnd the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let\u2019s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.\n\n21:58:19: LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal?\n\n21:58:20: OBAMA: Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn\u2019t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn\u2019t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn\u2019t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.\n\nIf they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they\u2019re paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don\u2019t have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they\u2019ve hit the limit.\n\nSo we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.\n\nAnd let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you\u2019ve got health insurance, it doesn\u2019t mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can\u2019t jerk you around. They can\u2019t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance \u2013 your insurance plan until you\u2019re 26 years old. And it also says that you\u2019re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.\n\nNumber two, if you don\u2019t have health insurance, we\u2019re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you\u2019re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.\n\nNow, the last point I\u2019d make before\u2026\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes \u2013 two minutes is up, sir.\n\nOBAMA: No, I think \u2013 I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was \u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 the irony is that we\u2019ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasn\u2019t destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.\n\n22:01:01: LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.\n\nAll right, Governor. Governor, tell \u2013 tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?\n\n22:01:10: ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:01:13: ROMNEY: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary \u2013 elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.\n\nSo entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.\n\nWhat we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn\u2019t raise taxes. You\u2019ve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn\u2019t cut Medicare. Of course, we don\u2019t have Medicare, but we didn\u2019t cut Medicare by $716 billion.\n\nWe didn\u2019t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\u2019re going to receive. We didn\u2019t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put \u2013 put people in a position where they\u2019re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.\n\nRight now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.\n\nSo for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don\u2019t want Medicare \u2013 don\u2019t want Obamacare. It\u2019s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had \u2013 had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside.\n\nI think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.\n\n22:03:12: OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.\n\nAnd I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan.\n\nIt \u2013 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?\n\nBecause there \u2013 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line.\n\nOr, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it.\n\nSo at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2013 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2013 they\u2019ve engaged in.\n\nNow, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2013 it\u2019s true \u2013 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate.\n\nLet me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2013 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance\u2026\n\n22:06:24: LEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\n22:06:25: OBAMA: \u2026 at a time when it\u2019s vitally important.\n\n22:06:26: LEHRER: Let\u2019s let the governor explain what you would do\u2026\n\n22:06:27: ROMNEY: Well\u2026\n\n22:06:28: LEHRER: \u2026 if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:06:33: ROMNEY: Well, actually it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.\n\nBut let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nIn my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2013 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.\n\nYour example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.\n\nThis is the private market. These are small \u2013 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2013 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.\n\nIn order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.\n\nBut the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.\n\nThat\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.\n\n22:08:36: OBAMA: Let me just point out first of all this board that we\u2019re talking about can\u2019t make decisions about what treatments are given. That\u2019s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\u2019s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nWell, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2013 if it\u2019s been under 90 days.\n\nBut that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d\n\nNow, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2013 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.\n\nIt just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry.\n\nAnd at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2013 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?\n\nNo. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.\n\n22:11:05: LEHRER: We\u2019re going to move to\u2026\n\n22:11:06: ROMNEY: No. I \u2013 I have to respond to that.\n\n22:11:08: LEHRER: No, but\u2026\n\n22:11:10: ROMNEY: Which is \u2013 which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and \u2013 and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \u201cIt\u2019s my way or the highway,\u201d I don\u2019t get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O\u2019Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You\u2019ve said the same thing, you\u2019re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.\n\nThose are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I\u2019m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what \u2013 what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2013 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time.\n\nThe federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.\n\n22:12:45: LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And \u2013 and let\u2019s see. Role of government. And it is \u2013 you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you \u2013 but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President \u2013 do you believe there\u2019s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?\n\n22:13:14: OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.\n\n22:13:15: LEHRER: And do you \u2013 yeah.\n\n22:13:16: OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That\u2019s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I\u2019ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\u2019ve been in the Oval Office.\n\nBut I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.\n\nLook, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.\n\nBut as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let\u2019s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let\u2019s start the National Academy of Sciences, let\u2019s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we\u2019re all going to be better off. That doesn\u2019t restrict people\u2019s freedom. That enhances it.\n\nAnd so what I\u2019ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.\n\nAnd when it comes to education what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn\u2019t a top-down approach, Governor. What we\u2019ve said is to states, we\u2019ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.\n\nBut what I\u2019ve also said is let\u2019s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can\u2019t all do that. In fact we\u2019ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn\u2019t think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.\n\nIt can\u2019t do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we\u2019ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\u2019ve got a skilled workforce.\n\n22:15:40: LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?\n\n22:15:43: ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers.\n\nSo I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.\n\nThe role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.\n\nFirst, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military.\n\nSecond, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2013 by one another.\n\nWe\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2013 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.\n\nBut we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2013 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working.\n\nAnd the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work.\n\n22:17:48: LEHRER: All right.\n\n22:17:49: ROMNEY: We know that the path we\u2019re taking is not working. It\u2019s time for a new path.\n\n22:17:50: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s go through some specifics in terms of what \u2013 how each of you views the role of government. How do \u2013 education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?\n\n22:18:03: ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is \u2013 is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I \u2013 and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he\u2019s \u2013 some ideas he\u2019s put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and \u2013 and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and \u2013 and state schools to do a better job.\n\nMy own view, by the way, is I\u2019ve added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I \u2013 these are disabled kids or \u2013 or \u2013 or poor kids or \u2013 or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.\n\nSo all federal funds, instead of going to the \u2013 to the state or to the school district, I\u2019d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their \u2013 their \u2013 their student.\n\n22:18:50: LEHRER: How do you see the federal government\u2019s responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?\n\n22:18:57: OBAMA: Well, as I\u2019ve indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we\u2019ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they\u2019re having an impact right now.\n\n22:19:20: LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and \u2013 and those of Governor Romney on \u2013 about education and the federal government?\n\n22:19:25: OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we\u2019re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.\n\nYou know, his \u2013 his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney\u2019s talked about. And it wasn\u2019t very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But \u2013 but what it did do is to \u2013 if you extrapolated how much money we\u2019re talking about, you\u2019d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.\n\nWhen it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they\u2019re setting up their training programs\u2026\n\n22:20:20: LEHRER: Do you \u2013 do you agree, Governor?\n\n22:20:21: OBAMA: Let me just finish the point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:20:23: OBAMA: The \u2013 where they\u2019re partnering so that they\u2019re designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that there\u2019s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.\n\nLet me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.\n\nAnd we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.\n\nGovernor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \u201cyou should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\u201d you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\u2019t have that option.\n\nAnd for us to be able to make sure that they\u2019ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow this economy over the long term.\n\n22:21:59: LEHRER: We\u2019re running out of time, gentlemen.\n\n(CROSSTALK) LEHRER: Governor?\n\n22:22:05: ROMNEY: Mr. President, Mr. President, you\u2019re entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I\u2019m not going to cut education funding. I don\u2019t have any plan to cut education funding and \u2013 and grants that go to people going to college. I\u2019m planning on (inaudible) to grow. So I\u2019m not planning on making changes there.\n\nBut you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into \u2013 into green jobs. And I \u2013 look, I\u2019m all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have \u2013 that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion.\n\nAnd these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.\n\nLook, the right course for America\u2019s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.\n\nThe right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a \u2013 to a school that he\u2019s being more successful.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\u2019ve had that experience. I don\u2019t just talk about it. I\u2019ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\u2019t have commitment to education. It\u2019s because I care about education for all of our kids.\n\n22:23:49: LEHRER: All right, gentlemen\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:23:51: LEHRER: Excuse me (inaudible). Excuse me, sir. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 barely have three minutes left. I\u2019m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I\u2019ve done a poor job.\n\nOBAMA: You\u2019ve done a great job.\n\nLEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government \u2013 the role of government and governing, we\u2019ve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three \u2013 three minutes left in the \u2013 in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we\u2019ve got three minutes total time here \u2013 and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that?\n\nGovernor?\n\n22:24:41: ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like it at the time \u2013 of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.\n\n22:24:50: LEHRER: But what would you do as president?\n\n22:24:50: ROMNEY: We \u2013 as president, I will sit on day one \u2013 actually, the day after I get elected \u2013 I\u2019ll sit down with leaders \u2013 the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue \u2013 as we did in my state \u2013 we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the \u2013 in the \u2013 in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we\u2019re going to compromise our principle, but because there\u2019s common ground.\n\nAnd the challenges America faces right now \u2013 look, the reason I\u2019m in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face \u2013 this deficit could crush the future generations. What\u2019s happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.\n\n22:25:53: LEHRER: All right.\n\n22:25:53: ROMNEY: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership \u2013 leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if \u2013 if it\u2019s a Republican or a Democrat. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ll do it again.\n\n22:25:56: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n22:25:57: OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney\u2019s going to have a busy first day, because he\u2019s also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you\u2019re sitting down with them.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they\u2019re advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause. That\u2019s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That\u2019s how we repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask/don\u2019t tell.\u201d That\u2019s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That\u2019s how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.\n\nSo we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \u201cI\u2019ll sit down,\u201d but you have to have a plan.\n\nNumber two, what\u2019s important is occasionally you\u2019ve got to say no, to \u2013 to \u2013 to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when \u2013 when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.\n\nWhen \u2013 when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.\n\nLEHRER: All right\n\nOBAMA: And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\n\n22:27:53: LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.\n\n22:28:05: OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.\n\nYou know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\u2019s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\u2019t lay off workers during a recession.\n\nThe auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\u2019re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that I\u2019ve tried to do, and everything that I\u2019m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\u2019re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.\n\nAll those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is \u2013 is channeled and \u2013 and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair shot. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair share \u2013 everybody\u2019s doing a fair share, and everybody\u2019s playing by the same rules.\n\nYou know, four years ago, I said that I\u2019m not a perfect man and I wouldn\u2019t be a perfect president. And that\u2019s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I\u2019ve kept. But I also promised that I\u2019d fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. I\u2019ve kept that promise and if you\u2019ll vote for me, then I promise I\u2019ll fight just as hard in a second term.\n\n22:30:17: LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.\n\n22:30:18: ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.\n\nThis is a \u2013 this is an important election and I\u2019m concerned about America. I\u2019m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.\n\nI \u2013 I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\u2019s bigger than our respective parties. It\u2019s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.\n\nAnd there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\u2019re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\u2019re talk about those two paths.\n\nBut they lead in very different directions. And it\u2019s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record.\n\nThere\u2019s no question in my mind that if the president were to be re-elected you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.\n\nI\u2019ll get incomes up again.\n\nYou\u2019ll see chronic unemployment. We\u2019ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.\n\nIf I\u2019m president I will create \u2013 help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.\n\nIf the president\u2019s re-elected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\u2019s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\u2019re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.\n\nIf I\u2019m elected we won\u2019t have Obama. We\u2019ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\u2019ll focus on getting the cost of health care down.\n\nIf the president were to be re-elected you\u2019re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You\u2019ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\u2019ll have hospital and providers that\u2019ll no longer accept Medicare patients.\n\nI\u2019ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.\n\nAnd finally, military. The president\u2019s re-elected you\u2019ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.\n\nI will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America\u2019s middle class working again.\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nLEHRER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October 11th at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I\u2019m Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.\n\n(APPLAUSE)"

    "text": "Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012 at 2:08 p.m.\n\nAsked about fair pay for women during the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama was quick to bring up the first piece of legislation he signed into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n\n\n\nAudience member Katherine Fenton asked Obama, \"In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?\"\n\n\n\nObama talked about being raised by a single mom who put herself through school and of his grandmother, who worked her way up from a bank secretary to a vice president but \"hit the glass ceiling.\"\n\n\n\n\"She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn't complain. That's not what you did in that generation,\" he said at the debate at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012. \"And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill.\"\n\n\n\nRomney responded by saying at one point he had more women in senior leadership positions than any other governor and that he wanted to help more women find jobs.\n\n\n\nObama jumped in, saying, \"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Gov. Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, \u2018I'll get back to you.\u2019 And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.\"\n\n\n\nDid Romney and his campaign really refuse to say whether he supported the law? Sort of.\n\n\n\nThe law, which Obama signed on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims but received little Republican support in Congress. It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate \u2014 making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.\n\n\n\nWhat did Romney have to say about it? For a previous fact-check in May, the Obama campaign directed us to a couple media reports.\n\n\n\nIn an April 2012 conference call covered by a Washington Post blogger, a Huffington Post reporter asked an unnamed Romney adviser whether Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The adviser responded, \"Sam (Stein), we\u2019ll get back to you on that.\"\n\n\n\nLater, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul clarified in an email, \"He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.\"\n\n\n\nThe second piece the Obama campaign showed us was a Romney interview by Diane Sawyer of ABC News. Sawyer asked Romney, \" If you were president \u2014 you had been president \u2014 would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?\"\n\n\n\nRomney\u2019s response:\n\nRomney: \"It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago \u2014\"\n\nSawyer: \"But would you have signed it?\"\n\nRomney: \"... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and \u2014 and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to.\"\n\nHere, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill into law. But he also said he has \"no intention of changing that law.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\n\n\nObama said that when asked whether he would have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act into law, Romney's campaign said, \"I'll get back to you.\" His point was that the campaign was dodging the question.\n\n\n\nIndeed, a Romney adviser did say earlier this year that he would \"get back\" to a reporter about whether he supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. A spokeswoman then said he would not change it, and Romney later said he \"certainly support(s) equal pay for women,\" and has \"no intention of changing that law.\"\n\n\n\nSo Obama is correct about the initial statement, but Romney later clarified by saying he wouldn't change the law. We rate Obama's claim Mostly True.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it \"impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.\" In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."

    "text": "John McCain's Acceptance Speech\n\n\n\n\n\nBy John McCain\n\nSeptember 5, 2008 Thank you all very much. Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans -- the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for President of the United States. And I accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence.\n\n\n\nIn my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to lead it to better days. Their support is an honor I won't forget.\n\n\n\nI'm grateful to the President for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable; and to the First Lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private. And I'm grateful to the 41st President and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding example of honorable service to our country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more, and can't imagine a life without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are -- victims of land mines, children born in poverty and with birth defects -- shows the measure of her humanity. I know she will make a great First Lady.\n\n\n\nWhen I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength, and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character.\n\n\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to all of you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it.\n\n\n\nFinally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other. We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement.\n\n\n\nBut let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election. And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace.\n\n\n\nThese are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. And that's just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future.\n\n\n\nAnd I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. She has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes, and taken on the special interests. She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She's the mother of five children. She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries.\n\n\n\nShe knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down. I'm very proud to have introduced our next Vice President to the country. But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming.\n\n\n\nI'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington, and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you.\n\n\n\nYou know, I've been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment and sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you.\n\n\n\nI've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I've fought big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses.\n\n\n\nI fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn't a popular thing to do. And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war.\n\n\n\nThanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petreaus, and the brave men and women he has the honor to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military, risked a wider war and threatened the security of all Americans.\n\n\n\nI don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test.\n\n\n\nI fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills.\n\n\n\nI fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her Master's Degree. They have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They matter to me.\n\n\n\nI fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honor their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to, remains safe from its enemies.\n\n\n\nI fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust, when we valued our power over our principles.\n\n\n\nWe're going to change that. We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics.\n\n\n\nWe believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans.\n\n\n\nWe believe in low taxes; spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor.\n\n\n\nWe believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal responsibility, the rule of law, and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench. We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods and communities.\n\n\n\nWe believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself.\n\n\n\nI will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.\n\n\n\nMy tax cuts will create jobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My health care plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good health care insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages, and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.\n\n\n\nKeeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from $3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see fit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity.\n\n\n\nI know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away.\n\n\n\nWe will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage.\n\n\n\nEducation is the civil rights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers, and help bad teachers find another line of work.\n\n\n\nWhen a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity.\n\n\n\nSenator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools to answer to parents and students. And when I'm President, they will.\n\n\n\nMy fellow Americans, when I'm President, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now. We will build more nuclear power plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase the use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the development and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles.\n\n\n\nSenator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet. It's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we have faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead.\n\n\n\nThis great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce.\n\n\n\nToday, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before us did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve.\n\n\n\nWe have dealt a serious blow to al Qaeda in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they'll strike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and prayers. As President I will work to establish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the Cold War. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people.\n\n\n\nWe face many threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and what it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to secure the peace.\n\n\n\nWhen I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination.\n\n\n\nI'm running for President to keep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal -- diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals -- to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace.\n\n\n\nIn America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it.\n\n\n\nWe need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution and the end of the Cold War. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe constant partisan rancor that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you.\n\n\n\nAgain and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as President. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.\n\n\n\nInstead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability.\n\n\n\nWe're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit.\n\n\n\nI've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, last and always. And I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege.\n\n\n\nLong ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, compassion and love.\n\n\n\nOn an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend a few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure; my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause more important than me.\n\n\n\nThen I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped in a dark cell, and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. When I didn't get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life.\n\n\n\nI was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners. Our Code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America. But I turned it down.\n\n\n\nA lot of prisoners had it worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. For a long time. And they broke me.\n\n\n\nWhen they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with. Because every day they fought for me.\n\n\n\nI fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's.\n\n\n\nI'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God.\n\n\n\nIf you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our Armed Forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself.\n\n\n\nI'm going to fight for my cause every day as your President. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.\n\n\n\nFight for what's right for our country.\n\n\n\nFight for the ideals and character of a free people.\n\n\n\nFight for our children's future.\n\n\n\nFight for justice and opportunity for all.\n\n\n\nStand up to defend our country from its enemies.\n\n\n\nStand up for each other; for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America.\n\n\n\nStand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\n\n\nThank you, and God Bless you."

    "text": "Community Blogs Post from Amanda Scott's Blog Senator Obama in Golden, CO: Confronting an Economic Crisis Comments | Mail to a Friend | Report Objectionable Content This afternoon in Golden, Colorado, Senator Obama delivered an address on the economic crisis. He outlined his record, his economic plan and how he will bring change when John McCain will bring more of the same. Here are some of his remarks... Over the last few days, we have seen clearly what\u2019s at stake in this election. The news from Wall Street has shaken the American people\u2019s faith in our economy. The situation with Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions is the latest in a wave of crises that have generated tremendous uncertainty about the future of our financial markets. This is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good-paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills, save for their future, and make their mortgage payments.\n\n\n\nSince this turmoil began over a year ago, the housing market has collapsed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to be effectively taken over by the government. Three of America\u2019s five largest investment banks failed or have been sold off in distress. Yesterday, Wall Street suffered its worst losses since just after 9/11. We are in the most serious financial crisis in generations. Yet Senator McCain stood up yesterday and said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\n\n\n\n...So let\u2019s be clear: what we\u2019ve seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed. And I am running for President of the United States because the dreams of the American people must not be endangered any more. It\u2019s time to put an end to a broken system in Washington that is breaking the American economy. It\u2019s time for change that makes a real difference in your lives.\n\n\n\n...Make no mistake: my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance. His outrage at Wall Street would be more convincing if he wasn\u2019t offering them more tax cuts. His call for fiscal responsibility would be believable if he wasn\u2019t for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and more of a trillion dollar war in Iraq paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like China. His newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement. John McCain cannot be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason: he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened these last eight years is not some historical anomaly, so we know what to expect if we try these policies for another four. When lobbyists run your campaign, the special interests end up gaming the system. When the White House is hostile to any kind of oversight, corporations cut corners and consumers pay the price. When regulators are chosen for their disdain for regulation and we gut their ability to enforce the law, then the interests of the American people are not protected. It\u2019s an ideology that intentionally breeds incompetence in Washington and irresponsibility on Wall Street, and it\u2019s time to turn the page.\n\n\n\nJust today, Senator McCain offered up the oldest Washington stunt in the book \u2013 you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem. But here\u2019s the thing ... we know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I\u2019ll provide it, John McCain won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the choice for the American people in this election. Read Barack's full remarks as prepared for delivery...\n\n\n\nRemarks of Senator Barack Obama\n\n\n\nConfronting an Economic Crisis\n\n\n\nAs Prepared For Delivery\n\n\n\nTuesday, September 16th, 2008\n\n\n\nGolden, Colorado\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last few days, we have seen clearly what\u2019s at stake in this election. The news from Wall Street has shaken the American people\u2019s faith in our economy. The situation with Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions is the latest in a wave of crises that have generated tremendous uncertainty about the future of our financial markets. This is a major threat to our economy and its ability to create good-paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills, save for their future, and make their mortgage payments.\n\n\n\nSince this turmoil began over a year ago, the housing market has collapsed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to be effectively taken over by the government. Three of America\u2019s five largest investment banks failed or have been sold off in distress. Yesterday, Wall Street suffered its worst losses since just after 9/11. We are in the most serious financial crisis in generations. Yet Senator McCain stood up yesterday and said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong\n\n\n\nA few hours later, his campaign sent him back out to clean up his remarks, and he tried to explain himself again this morning by saying that what he meant was that American workers are strong. But we know that Senator McCain meant what he said the first time, because he has said it over and over again throughout this campaign \u2013 no fewer than 16 times, according to one independent count.\n\n\n\nNow I certainly don\u2019t fault Senator McCain for all of the problems we\u2019re facing, but I do fault the economic philosophy he subscribes to. Because the truth is, what Senator McCain said yesterday fits with the same economic philosophy that he\u2019s had for 26 years. It\u2019s the philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down. It\u2019s the philosophy that says even common-sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise. It\u2019s a philosophy that lets Washington lobbyists shred consumer protections and distort our economy so it works for the special interests instead of working people.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had this philosophy for eight years. We know the results. You feel it in your own lives. Jobs have disappeared, and peoples\u2019 life savings have been put at risk. Millions of families face foreclosure, and millions more have seen their home values plummet. The cost of everything from gas to groceries to health care has gone up, while the dream of a college education for our kids and a secure and dignified retirement for our seniors is slipping away. These are the struggles that Americans are facing. This is the pain that has now trickled up.\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear: what we\u2019ve seen the last few days is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed. And I am running for President of the United States because the dreams of the American people must not be endangered any more. It\u2019s time to put an end to a broken system in Washington that is breaking the American economy. It\u2019s time for change that makes a real difference in your lives.\n\n\n\nIf you want to understand the difference between how Senator McCain and I would govern as President, you can start by taking a look at how we\u2019ve responded to this crisis. Because Senator McCain's approach was the same as the Bush Administration\u2019s: support ideological policies that made the crisis more likely; do nothing as the crisis hits; and then scramble as the whole thing collapses. My approach has been to try to prevent this turmoil.\n\n\n\nIn February of 2006, I introduced legislation to stop mortgage transactions that promoted fraud, risk or abuse. A year later, before the crisis hit, I warned Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke about the risks of mounting foreclosures and urged them to bring together all the stakeholders to find solutions to the subprime mortgage meltdown. Senator McCain did nothing.\n\n\n\nLast September, I stood up at NASDAQ and said it\u2019s time to realize that we are in this together \u2013 that there is no dividing line between Wall Street and Main Street \u2013 and warned of a growing loss of trust in our capital markets. Months later, Senator McCain told a newspaper that he\u2019d love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis, \u201cbut\u201d \u2013 he said \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know one.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn January, I outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy, which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress. Senator McCain used the crisis as an excuse to push a so-called stimulus plan that offered another huge and permanent corporate tax cut, including $4 billion for the big oil companies, but no immediate help for workers.\n\n\n\nThis March, in the wake of the Bear Stearns bailout, I called for a new, 21st century regulatory framework to restore accountability, transparency, and trust in our financial markets. Just a few weeks earlier, Senator McCain made it clear where he stands: \u201cI\u2019m always for less regulation,\u201d he said, and referred to himself as \u201cfundamentally a deregulator.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is what happens when you confuse the free market with a free license to let special interests take whatever they can get, however they can get it. This is what happens when you see seven years of incomes falling for the average worker while Wall Street is booming, and declare \u2013 as Senator McCain did earlier this year \u2013 that we\u2019ve made great progress economically under George Bush. That is how you can reach the conclusion \u2013 as late as yesterday \u2013 that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\n\n\n\nWell, we have a different way of measuring the fundamentals of our economy. We know that the fundamentals that we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great \u2013that America is a place where you can make it if you try.\n\n\n\nAmericans have always pursued our dreams within a free market that has been the engine of our progress. It\u2019s a market that has created a prosperity that is the envy of the world, and rewarded the innovators and risk-takers who have made America a beacon of science, and technology, and discovery. But the American economy has worked in large part because we have guided the market\u2019s invisible hand with a higher principle \u2013 that America prospers when all Americans can prosper. That is why we have put in place rules of the road to make competition fair, and open, and honest.\n\n\n\nToo often, over the last quarter century, we have lost this sense of shared prosperity. And this has not happened by accident. It\u2019s because of decisions made in boardrooms, on trading floors and in Washington. We failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices. We let the special interests put their thumbs on the economic scales. The result has been a distorted market that creates bubbles instead of steady, sustainable growth; a market that favors Wall Street over Main Street, but ends up hurting both.\n\n\n\nLet me be clear: the American economy does not stand still, and neither should the rules that govern it. The evolution of industries often warrants regulatory reform - to foster competition, lower prices, or replace outdated oversight structures. Old institutions cannot adequately oversee new practices. Old rules may not fit the roads where our economy is leading. But instead of sensible reform that rewarded success and freed the creative forces of the market, too often we\u2019ve excused an ethic of greed, corner-cutting and inside dealing that threatens the long-term stability of our economic system.\n\n\n\nIt happened in the 1980s, when we loosened restrictions on Savings and Loans and appointed regulators who ignored even these weaker rules. Too many S&Ls took advantage of the lax rules set by Washington to gamble that they could make big money in speculative real estate. Confident of their clout in Washington, they made hundreds of billions in bad loans, knowing that if they lost money, the government would bail them out. And they were right. The gambles did not pay off, our economy went into recession, and the taxpayers ended up footing the bill. Sound familiar?\n\n\n\nAnd it has happened again during this decade, in part because of how we deregulated the financial services sector. After we repealed outmoded rules instead of updating them, we were left overseeing 21st century innovation with 20th century regulations. When subprime mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn, a patchwork of regulators systematically and deliberately eliminated the regulations protecting the American people and failed to raise warning flags that could have protected investors and the pensions American workers count on.\n\n\n\nThis was not the invisible hand of the market at work. These cycles of bubble and bust were symptoms of the ideology that my opponent is running to continue. John McCain has spent decades in Washington supporting financial institutions instead of their customers. In fact, one of the biggest proponents of deregulation in the financial sector is Phil Gramm \u2013 the same man who helped write John McCain\u2019s economic plan; the same man who said that we\u2019re going through a \u2018mental recession\u2019; and the same man who called the United States of America a \u201cnation of whiners.\u201d So it\u2019s hard to understand how Senator McCain is going to get us out of this crisis by doing the same things with the same old players.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake: my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance. His outrage at Wall Street would be more convincing if he wasn\u2019t offering them more tax cuts. His call for fiscal responsibility would be believable if he wasn\u2019t for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, and more of a trillion dollar war in Iraq paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like China. His newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement. John McCain cannot be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason: he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened these last eight years is not some historical anomaly, so we know what to expect if we try these policies for another four. When lobbyists run your campaign, the special interests end up gaming the system. When the White House is hostile to any kind of oversight, corporations cut corners and consumers pay the price. When regulators are chosen for their disdain for regulation and we gut their ability to enforce the law, then the interests of the American people are not protected. It\u2019s an ideology that intentionally breeds incompetence in Washington and irresponsibility on Wall Street, and it\u2019s time to turn the page.\n\n\n\nJust today, Senator McCain offered up the oldest Washington stunt in the book \u2013 you pass the buck to a commission to study the problem. But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 this isn\u2019t 9/11. We know how we got into this mess. What we need now is leadership that gets us out. I\u2019ll provide it, John McCain won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the choice for the American people in this election.\n\n\n\nHistory shows us that there is no substitute for presidential leadership in a time of economic crisis. FDR and Harry Truman didn\u2019t put their heads in the sand, or hand accountability over to a Commission. Bill Clinton didn\u2019t put off hard choices. They led, and that\u2019s what I will do. My priority as President will be the stability of the American economy and the prosperity of the American people. And I will make sure that our response focuses on middle class Americans \u2013 not the companies that created the problem.\n\n\n\nTo get out of this crisis \u2013 and to ensure that we are not doomed to repeat a cycle of bubble and bust again and again \u2013 we must take immediate measures to create jobs and continue to address the housing crisis; we must build a 21st century regulatory framework, and we must pursue a bold opportunity agenda that creates new jobs and grows the American economy.\n\n\n\nTo jumpstart job creation, I have proposed a $50 billion Emergency Economic Plan that would save 1 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, repairing our schools, and helping our states and localities avoid damaging budget cuts.\n\n\n\nI worked with leaders in Congress to create a new FHA Housing Security Program, which will help stabilize the housing market and allow Americans facing foreclosure to keep their homes at rates they can afford. Going forward, we need to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as we know them with a structure that is focused on helping people buy homes \u2013 not engaging in market speculation. We can\u2019t have a situation like the old S&L scandal where its \u201cheads\u201d investors win, and \u201ctails\u201d taxpayers lose. That\u2019s going to take ending the lobbyist-driven dominance of these institutions that we\u2019ve seen for far too long in Washington.\n\n\n\nTo prevent fraud in the mortgage market, I've proposed tough penalties on fraudulent lenders, and a Home Score system that will ensure consumers fully understand mortgage offers and whether they'll be able to make payments. To help low- and middle-income families, I will ease the burden on struggling homeowners through a universal homeowner\u2019s tax credit. This will add up to a 10 percent break off the mortgage interest rate for 10 million households. That\u2019s another $500 each year for many middle class families.\n\n\n\nUnlike Senator McCain, I will change our bankruptcy laws to make it easier for families to stay in their homes. Right now, if you\u2019re a family that owns one house, bankruptcy judges are actually barred from helping you keep a roof over your head by writing down the value of your mortgage. If you own seven homes, the judge is free to write down any or all of the debt on your second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh homes. Now that may be of comfort to Senator McCain, but that\u2019s the kind of out-of-touch Washington loophole that makes no sense. When I\u2019m President, we\u2019ll make our laws work for working people.\n\n\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen the last few days, the crisis in our financial markets now reaches well beyond the housing market. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time to do what I called for last September and again this past March \u2013 and it is only more overdue today.\n\n\n\nOur capital markets cannot succeed without the public's trust. It\u2019s time to get serious about regulatory oversight, and that\u2019s what I will do as President. That starts with the core principles for reform that I discussed at Cooper Union.\n\n\n\nFirst, if you\u2019re a financial institution that can borrow from the government, you should be subject to government oversight and supervision. When the Federal Reserve steps in as a lender of last resort, it is providing an insurance policy underwritten by the American taxpayer. In return, taxpayers have every right to expect that financial institutions with access to that credit are not taking excessive risks.\n\n\n\nSecond, we must reform requirements on all regulated financial institutions. We must strengthen capital requirements, particularly for complex financial instruments like some of the mortgage securities and other derivatives at the center of our current crisis. We must develop and rigorously manage liquidity risk. We must investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating. And we must establish transparency requirements that demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders and counterparties. As we reform our regulatory system at home, we must address the same problems abroad so that financial institutions around the world are subject to similar rules of the road.\n\n\n\nThird, we need to streamline our regulatory agencies. Our overlapping and competing regulatory agencies cannot oversee the large and complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape. Different institutions compete in multiple markets - Washington should not pretend otherwise. A streamlined system will provide better oversight and reduce costs.\n\n\n\nFourth, we need to regulate institutions for what they do, not what they are. Over the last few years, commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies. This regulatory framework failed to protect homeowners, and made no sense for our financial system. When it comes to protecting the American people, it should make no difference what kind of institution they are dealing with.\n\n\n\nFifth, we must crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation. The last six months have shown that this remains a serious problem in many markets and becomes especially problematic during moments of great financial turmoil. We cannot embrace the administration's vision of turning over the protection of investors to the industries themselves. We need regulators that actually enforce the rules instead of overlooking them. The SEC should investigate and punish market manipulation, and report its conclusions to Congress.\n\n\n\nSixth, we must establish a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system like the crisis that has overtaken our economy. Too often, we end up where we are today: dealing with threats to the financial system that weren't anticipated by regulators. We need a standing financial market advisory group to meet regularly and provide advice to the President, Congress, and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks they face. It\u2019s time to anticipate risks before they erupt into a full-blown crisis.\n\n\n\nThese six principles should guide the legal reforms needed to establish a 21st century regulatory system. But the change we need goes beyond laws and regulation. Financial institutions must do a better job at managing risks. There is something wrong when boards of directors or senior managers don't understand the implications of the risks assumed by their own institutions. It's time to realign incentives and CEO compensation packages, so that both high level executives and employees better serve the interests of shareholders.\n\n\n\nFinally, the American people must be able to trust that their government is looking out for all of us - not the special interests that have set the agenda in Washington for eight years, and the lobbyists who run John McCain\u2019s campaign.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve spent my career taking on lobbyists and their money, and I\u2019ve won. If you wanted a special favor in Illinois, there was actually a law that let you give campaign cash to politicians for their own personal use. In the State House, they called it business-as-usual. I called it legalized bribery, and while it didn\u2019t make me the most popular guy in Springfield, I put an end to it.\n\n\n\nWhen I got to Washington, we saw some of the worst corruption since Watergate. I led the fight for reform in my party, and let me tell you \u2013 not everyone in my party was too happy about it. When I proposed forcing lobbyists to disclose who they\u2019re raising money from and who in Congress they\u2019re funneling it to, I had a few choice words directed my way on the floor of the Senate. But we got it done, and we banned gifts from lobbyists, and free rides on their fancy jets. And I am the only candidate who can say that Washington lobbyists do not fund my campaign, they will not run my White House, and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am President of the United States. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to end the outrage of special interests tipping the scales.\n\n\n\nThe most important thing we must do is restore opportunity for all Americans. To get our economy growing, we need to recapture that fundamental American promise. That if you work hard, you can pay the bills. That if you get sick, you won\u2019t go bankrupt. That your kids can get a good education, and that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to future generations.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the change the American people need. While Senator McCain likes to talk about change these days, his economic program offers nothing but more of the same. The American people need more than change as a slogan\u2013 we need change that makes a real difference in your life.\n\n\n\nChange means a tax code that doesn\u2019t reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it. I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start-ups \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019ll grow our economy and create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.\n\n\n\nI will cut taxes \u2013 cut taxes \u2013 for 95% of all working families. My opponent doesn\u2019t want you to know this, but under my plan, tax rates will actually be less than they were under Ronald Reagan. If you make less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increase one single dime. In fact, I offer three times the tax relief for middle-class families as Senator McCain does \u2013 because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.\n\n\n\nI will finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And I will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most\n\n\n\nI will create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy. We\u2019ll tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I\u2019ll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I\u2019ll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I\u2019ll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy \u2013 wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can\u2019t ever be outsourced\n\n\n\nAnd now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. I\u2019ll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. But in exchange, I will ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American \u2013 if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.\n\n\n\nThis is the change we need \u2013 the kind of bottom up growth and innovation that will advance the American economy by advancing the dreams of all Americans.\n\n\n\nTimes are hard. I will not pretend that the changes we need will come without cost \u2013 though I have presented ways we can achieve these changes in a fiscally responsible way. I know that we'll have to overcome our doubts and divisions and the determined opposition of powerful special interests before we can truly reform a broken economy and advance opportunity.\n\n\n\nBut I am running for President because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for Wall Street instead of Main Street, and ends up devastating both.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to wake up in four years to find that more Americans fell out of the middle-class, and more families lost their savings. I don\u2019t want to see that our country failed to invest in our ability to compete, our children\u2019s future was mortgaged on another mountain of debt, and our financial markets failed to find a firmer footing.\n\n\n\nThis time \u2013 this election \u2013 is our chance to stand up and say: enough is enough!\n\n\n\nWe can do this because Americans have done this before. Time and again, we\u2019ve battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other\u2019s success. That\u2019s why our economy hasn\u2019t just been the world\u2019s greatest wealth generator \u2013 it\u2019s bound America together, it\u2019s created jobs, and it\u2019s made the dream of opportunity a reality for generation after generation of Americans.\n\n\n\nNow it falls to us. And I need you to make it happen. If you want the next four years looking just like the last eight, then I am not your candidate. But if you want real change \u2013 if you want an economy that rewards work, and that works for Main Street and Wall Street; if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs; if you want health care you can afford and education so that our kids can compete; then I ask you to knock on some doors, and make some calls, and talk to your neighbors, and give me your vote on November 4th. And if you do, I promise you \u2013 we will win Colorado, we will win this election, and we will change America together.\n\n\n\n"

The debate over gun control heats up.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: One hundred days after Newtown, Congress gets ready to vote on new measures to prevent mass shootings. But is the call to action starting to fade? We'll ask a leading voice in the debate, former astronaut Mark Kelly, husband of Gabrielle Giffords. It's a \"Fox News Sunday\" exclusive.\n\nThen, how will the new pope change the Catholic Church? As the world celebrates Easter, Pope Francis must shepherd the church out of scandal and confront challenges to Catholic doctrine. We'll talk with the archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.\n\nPlus, North Korea enters a state of war against South Korea. We'll ask our Sunday panel, have the fiery threats reached the danger point?\n\nAnd our Power Player of the Week -- the untold story of how a doctor saved the life of Ronald Reagan.\n\nAll, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: Hello, again, and happy Easter from Fox News in Washington.\n\nWell, after months of debate, the Senate is finally ready to vote on new gun control legislation. One of the people at the center of the issue is Mark Kelly, retired astronaut and Navy captain, and the husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot two years ago.\n\nCaptain Kelly joins us from Tucson, Arizona.\n\nCaptain, after Newtown, there was national outrage over these acts of mass violence, but that has begun to change. CBS has a new poll, just after the massacre, 57 percent supported stricter gun controls. Now, that's down to 47 percent.\n\nAnd, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says the bill he'll introduce the week after next won't include a ban on assault weapons and won't include a limit on high capacity magazines.\n\nQuestion -- should President Obama have moved faster to bring it to a vote before the call for action began to fade?\n\nCAPTAIN MARK KELLY, (RET.) U.S. NAVY: Well, I think, after something like, you know, 20 first graders being murdered in their classrooms, you know, it is important to take action. And the American people are demanding action now. You know, the timeline of that, you know, sometimes, especially with a polarized Congress, these things can take a long time.\n\nBut, it's clear -- and you say that, you know, there is less support and I want to address that for a second. When you use words like gun control, you know, gun control doesn't poll very well, but we do know that over 90 percent of Americans support a universal background check. And, there is incredible momentum in Congress and around the nation to get this done.\n\nWALLACE: Well, you say incredible momentum. Five Republican senators say that they are going to filibuster any additional gun restrictions. We have them up on the screen.\n\nWhat do you say, for instance, to Marco Rubio and Rand Paul?\n\nKELLY: Well, first, I would say to Marco Rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check.\n\nFor Senator Rand Paul, it's about 83 percent, in Kentucky. So, they should listen to their constituents and, certainly, shouldn't be getting in the way of the process, which is to debate the bill and to vote on the bill. I mean, that doesn't make any sense.\n\nAnd, I imagine that at some point, if they actually do this, that their constituents will hold them accountable for those actions.\n\nWALLACE: Why do you think there is, in polls -- I mean, there are a couple of things going on here. One, we see in the polls, diminishing support. Two, we see Harry Reid, who is, you know, the Senate majority leader, and he's not even going to include the high capacity magazines or the assault weapons ban in the bill. They'll be a vote of amendments, but they're not part of the bill. He says in the assault weapons ban, it wouldn't get 40 votes, let alone 60.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nKELLY: Well, certainly, you know, in this country we have a very powerful gun lobby and the leadership of the NRA has done a very good job over many, many years of controlling the debate on this issue. But, one thing that is different now, is the fact that we had 20 first graders murdered in a classroom, along with six educators. I mean, that's unacceptable.\n\nAnd the American people, you know, want something done on this. You know, 92 percent of Americans support a universal background check. It's 74 percent of NRA members.\n\nI would hope at some point that the leadership of the NRA would just listen to their membership on this issue.\n\nWALLACE: We're going to get to the background check in a second. One last question about the Senate, because Republicans say they are going to offer an alternative bill that would crack down on gun trafficking and would beef up school safety. It would not include the background check or an assault weapons ban.\n\nWhat do you think of what's called the \"Grassley alternative\"?\n\nKELLY: Well, you know, I think it is a mistake. Any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake. It's the most common-sense thing that we can do to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons.\n\nI mean, the system we have right now, we have 40 percent of all Americans who buy a gun, buy it without a background check and that's probably where most of the criminals and the mentally ill are going. I mean, we know from a poll that has been done with criminals in prison, that over 80 percent of them get them through that loophole.\n\nSo, it would be a mistake not to address the thing that 92 percent of American households support and 74 percent of NRA members support, which is the universal background check.\n\nWALLACE: All right. Well, let's pick up on that, because the main feature of what is going to be in the Senate bill and what you are pushing and pushing today is the universal background check. This week, you went -- or rather, recently, a few weeks ago, you went to a gun store in the Arizona area, and bought a .45 caliber hand gun and afterwards discussed the background check you had to go through with your wife, Gabby.\n\nLet's take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKELLY: It was very easy to do. It took just like five minutes.\n\nFORMER REP. GABBY GIFFORDS, D-ARIZ.: Yes. Five minutes.\n\nKELLY: You know, that's all we have to do to make sure everybody has to get a background check before buying a gun, to make sure that criminals and the mentally ill can't get one.\n\nGIFFORDS: Universal background check.\n\nKELLY: Yes.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Captain Kelly, what do you think that showed?\n\nKELLY: Well, you know, we went in there, my executive director (inaudible), the executive of our organization, and in five minutes and 36 seconds is the time it took to fill out one piece of paper. You only have to fill out one side for it to be submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and get an answer. Five minutes and 36 seconds.\n\nSo, what it shows you is that it is not the burden that the NRA leadership says, what a background check is. I mean, it's s a simple, common sense thing we can do to make sure criminals and the mentally ill can't have access to firearms.\n\nWALLACE: Well, let's talk about that, because, in Gabby's tragic case, the shooter, Jared Loughner, had been suspended from college, because he was deemed to be a threat to himself and to others. He went to a gun store, he got a gun, passed a background check. And, yet was able to go out and shoot Gabby and 18 other people.\n\nAnd, the NRA says the problem with the background check is that -- the kind of mental health information, for instance in Loughner's case, doesn't get passed on. So, it doesn't get to be part of the background check.\n\nKELLY: Well, it doesn't get passed on in a lot of cases. You know, you know, 19 states have included less than 100 records on mental illness into the NICS, into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. In the case of the shooter in Tucson, the information on his mental illness, that caused him to get expelled from community college, that should have been in the system. His admitted drug use to the U.S. Army, who rejected him, that should have been in the system.\n\nSo he should have -- if we had, you know, a system -- if we improved the system, he would have been rejected from buying the gun in the gun store. Now, the other problem is, there's the other loophole, right? There's the records loophole, but there is the loophole that would allow him to go to a gun show, or on the Internet to buy a gun.\n\nAnd we need to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from doing that. It's crazy that we have a system -- you know, we have a system that responsible gun owners get a background check, and the option to avoid one is available for anybody who doesn't want to do it. I mean, it's a -- it's a crazy system.\n\nWALLACE: But doesn't the NRA have a point: if you're going to expand the background check and cover more people, don't you have to make sure the mental health information gets into the system, because otherwise it's kind of a waste of time?\n\nKELLY: They absolutely have a point. I mean, they are -- they are right on that issue.\n\nI mean, we need to encourage states to include the mental health records. After Virginia Tech, for instance, Virginia was one of the worst states on this. And after what happened in Virginia Tech, they're actually really, really good about getting those records to the federal government.\n\nSo I'm encouraging -- I mean, I would love to be able to work with the leadership of the NRA and work with the United States Senate and the House to make sure we get those records in the system and then close the gun show and private seller loophole, like 92 percent of Americans want, like 74 percent of NRA members want.\n\nWALLACE: The big hold-up in the Senate now over the background check is that if you do expand it to include gun shows and private sales, do the people who sell the guns in those cases have to keep private records? Keep records of those sales? And as you well know, the NRA says the danger is that if they have to do what licensed dealers have to do and keep those records, that could be used to form a national registry and somewhere down the line, that could be used to confiscate people's guns.\n\nHow do you respond to that?\n\nKELLY: Well, I just don't think it's logical. I mean, right now, when you buy a gun in a gun store like I did, you know, there is a record that remains with the gun store. It's not a record with the federal government. It is not a record that is going to one day lead to a national registry, or gun confiscation.\n\nSo the system currently works with the federally licensed firearms dealers. There is no reason that same system cannot work with the gun show, and the private seller. But, of course, this is an issue for many, you know, some Republican senators. And it's certainly something that could be worked on. I mean, we've got a lot of smart members in the Senate and I think they can figure out a compromise on this issue.\n\nWALLACE: Finally, Arizona officials this week released a lot of records about the shooter, Jared Loughner, the man who shot Gabby and 18 others. His parents, it turns out, knew he was deeply disturbed. They tested him for drugs, but they did not send him to get help.\n\nWhat do you have to say after learning all of this to Jared Loughner's parents?\n\nKELLY: Well, certainly as a parent, myself, I understand. I mean, it is a tragic thing they went through as well. It would have been an entirely different situation, however, if he would have gotten some mental health -- you know, gotten an evaluation. And when he -- you know, certainly in his case, when he's taking medication, he's not as psychotic as without the medication.\n\nSo, this would have clearly been -- would not have happened if he would have had proper mental health treatment, you know? But you can't -- you know, you can't go back in time. I mean, there's -- you know, the only thing we can do is move forward and try to make sure that the dangerously mentally ill are not only getting treatment for their mental illness, but let's make sure they don't have access to guns. Let's make sure criminals don't have access to guns.\n\nI mean, our organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions -- I mean, we are really focused on this, every, single day. To make sure we fix this problem, and we address gun violence in this country.\n\nWALLACE: I just want to pick up on that last point, because after Newtown, there was a lot of talk about making it easier for authorities, a school or a family to commit a Jared Loughner, an Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter before they got access to guns and acted out in this horrible way. But, that seems to have been forgotten in all of the debate about gun control.\n\nKELLY: Well, I don't know if it has been forgotten. I mean, certainly, you know, the debate in the Senate is going to -- going to include some aspect of help for the mentally ill. Now, what that is, you know, I'm not -- you know, I don't know what those details -- how that's going to turn out but that is certainly an important component of this. I mean, to address mental illness in this country, to get those records of mental illness into the system and then to make sure that there isn't a loophole where the clearly dangerously and mentally ill and criminals can get access to a gun.\n\nWALLACE: Captain Kelly, we want to thank you. Thank you for joining us. And we want to wish you and your wife, Gabby, the very best, sir.\n\nKELLY: Thank you, and, happy Easter, Chris.\n\nWALLACE: Happy Easter to you.\n\nUp next on this Easter Sunday, we'll discuss the new pope and the challenges he faces as we talk with one of the men who elected him, Washington's cardinal, Donald Wuerl.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Today at the Vatican, Pope Francis celebrated his first Easter mass as leader of the world's 1 billion Catholics. In the traditional Easter message, the pope called for a political solution to the civil war in Syria, as well as peace on the Korean peninsula.\n\nAs his papacy begins, Francis has set a humble tone in contrast to the corruption and scandal in some parts of the church. But, how much does the new pope intend to shake things up?\n\nEarlier, I asked the archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, what he thinks Pope Francis will do.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: Your Eminence, happy Easter and welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nCARDINAL DONALD WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: Thank you. It's great to be back.\n\nWALLACE: From the moment he took the world stage, Pope Francis talked about serving the poorest, the weakest, the least important. On Holy Thursday, he followed the tradition of washing the feet of 12 people. But instead of 12 priests as other popes have done, he washed and kissed the feet of a dozen young inmates, including women and Muslims.\n\nQuestion -- what message is the pope sending about what he is going to do?\n\nWUERL: I think his message is a very clear one, that you bear witness with words, but you also bear witness with actions. And I think what he is trying to say to all of us is, if we really are trying to introduce people to the gospel, if we are really trying to tell believers how important the gospel is, can't you do that as well, maybe even better, with actions as well as words. I think that's what he's trying to do.\n\nWALLACE: There is a widespread sense that the church has problems, governance problems. That there is corruption inside the church, that there are turf wars. One of the first things the pope has to deal with is that secret investigative report about the Vatican leaks.\n\nWhy did the cardinals believe that Pope Francis was the right man to clean things up?\n\nWUERL: I think there are probably a couple of ideas that were going around as we were talking about who might be the next pope, who would be the best person to choose. One, when we talk about the church, we also want to make sure that we distinguish it from just the operation of the Vatican. I think we were concerned about who will keep the momentum of the new evangelization going and who will keep this energy the church is seeing among many of our young people around the world. Who will keep that going?\n\nAt the same time, somebody has to address the administration of the Holy See. Somebody has to take a look at what is working and what isn't working. I can't tell you what that means, because we didn't have the report. But the very fact that we recognize there needs to be some change, that was a part of the thinking.\n\nCan you -- can you envision someone better than Pope Francis? The credibility he brings to whatever he decides, in the Vatican, is going to be enormous. But, in the meantime, he is keeping the focus on the rest of the church, where there is an awful lot of good going on.\n\nWALLACE: But on the inside game, how aggressive a reformer, how revolutionary, if you will, do you expect Pope Francis to be -- not on doctrine -- but on changing the way the church does business?\n\nWUERL: Well, perhaps we're seeing signs of it in the fact that he hasn't moved in to the papal residence, that he's chosen to stay in the residence where we all were for the conclave. Maybe he's simply saying, there are going to be a lot of changes, we're going to get back to something that will be a little more direct, and maybe contact with the pope will be a little easier.\n\nAnd that was one of the things that we cardinals talked about -- the need to find ways in which there is a lot more communication between the rest of the church and the pope.\n\nWALLACE: All right. You were there. We saw all of the pictures. Take us inside. This is your first conclave. Take us inside the Sistine Chapel. They closed the doors, the 115 cardinal electors are all there and you are choosing the head of church, for 1.2 billion, 1.3 billion Catholics.\n\nWhat is that moment like?\n\nWUERL: There is a solemnness that I really wasn't prepared to experience as fully. When you hear that door closing, you hear it, and the -- that bolt is locked, then you realize, this is really a liturgy. We're all -- we're all wearing what we would wear if we were presiding at a mass, somewhere. Not as the celebrant but simply as a cardinal.\n\nThis absolute silence -- and the one thing you are supposed to be doing is listening with your heart. Before I went in, I talked to one of the older cardinals, he's 90 years old. He came to one of those general meetings, just so we could chat. I have known him for 40 years.\n\nAnd I said to him, \"Cardinal, I am feeling a little bit overwhelmed by all of this.\" He said, \"When you get into the Sistine Chapel and they close that door, just listen with your heart. And you'll hear.\"\n\nAnd it turned out to be true. There is a solemn oath you take, and, then, Chris, when the moment comes to write a name on the ballot. There is nobody there but you and, I like to think, the Holy Spirit, guiding that pen.\n\nWALLACE: I'm fascinated. There were five ballots. Obviously, the fifth ballot you chose the pope. After a ballot, and they tell you, so-and-so, Bergoglio, Pope Francis has so many votes. Do you mill about and talk and --\n\nWUERL: No. This is the interesting thing. They count the ballots and that in itself is rather solemn. Three people look at each ballot, and go through the whole thing, so -- once it's clear no one was elected, nothing is said.\n\nThere is this moment, quiet, and then, you just write another name on the next ballot. It is as if the Holy Spirit is saying, look, now you know the direction, OK. You're going to have to -- you're going to have to whittle this down.\n\nThis is the power of the part, though, Chris, you have your ballot in your hand and you have to stand there in front of that fresco of the last judgment, and say, \"I call on Christ the Lord, who will come to judge me that this ballot is for the person I believe should serve and lead the church.\" And it's really powerful.\n\nBut, there is no milling about. There is no discussion. There -- it's altogether different than anything that you and I have experienced in our life here, politically. There are no nominations, no candidates. It's all open to the action of the spirit.\n\nWALLACE: Not exactly like pulling the lever on election day.\n\nThe big story in Washington, this week, as you well know has been the Supreme Court's consideration of the issue of same sex marriage. If the court finds that there is a constitutional right, what will you say to gays, who are good Catholics, attend church every week, who say, who believe that God made them that way, and who want to commit to a partner?\n\nWUERL: We are always welcoming of everyone. The Catholic Church welcomes everyone.\n\nBut, the Catholic Church also reminds all of us, there is a moral law. There are commandments of God, and we have to do our best to live by them. We announce that from the pulpit and, we try to meet people where they are and walk with them in life's journey.\n\nThe church is probably, with 20 centuries of experience, probably the most understanding of the human condition of any institution. But, at the same time it does remind, not only gay people, but heterosexual people, straight people, you're not supposed to be following a moral law apart from what Christ has said to us.\n\nWe do that all the time --\n\nWALLACE: So, specifically, what do you say, what would you say to the good, gay Catholic?\n\nWUERL: I think we try to work with them, whatever situation they find themselves in. The goal is to hold them as close to the church and to Christ and the sacraments as possible. A lot depends on how well we're able to communicate, how well we're able in a pastoral situation to look at each person's life and see where we are.\n\nWALLACE: So, you would allow him to continue in the church but you would not recognize his marriage?\n\nWUERL: We do that with people who are married, divorced and remarried. We say you are still part of the family, but we can't recognize that second marriage. We do that, we've done that -- and it has never been a great problem.\n\nIt's painful for all of us to have to realize that making our way through life is difficult and, that we can't always be as perfect as away would like to be. I look to the church to say to me, look, walk as close to Christ as you can. That's why we are here. Come to mass. Participate in the life of the church.\n\nWALLACE: I want to ask you about the legal situation. Canada legalized same sex marriage in 2005 and there have been legal problems. There was a case of a Knights of Columbus hall that had agreed to hold a reception for a married couple, until they found out that it was a same sex couple and they had to pay a fine.\n\nAnd there are questions, about a Catholic university that has housing for married couples, what are they going to do if it's a same sex couple. How is the church and the -- writ large, not just the church but the whole religious institution, how is it going to deal with that and doesn't it get a little bit to the issue you have with the administration, about the mandate of insurance policies, including birth control?\n\nWUERL: Shouldn't there be enough space in a society as pluralistic and free as America is to be able to work all of these things out in a way that everybody can be who they are, and carry on their activities?\n\nI'm thinking for example when we talk about changing the definition of marriage. There is going to have to be a lot of adjusting, because the whole world has always understood marriage is the word you use to describe when a man and a woman commit to each other for the rest of their lives, and generate and educate children. Once you change that arbitrarily, there is going to be downstream from that, all kinds of questions. We're going to have to deal with them one by one as we come to them and that's why the church keeps saying, make room for everyone's faith.\n\nThe only thing I worry about is someone saying to see, you, because you believe that sex is intended for marriage, and because you believe that marriage is undissolvable and because you believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, that somehow you don't belong here, that somehow this is -- this is bigotry or this is hate speech. That's what I worry about.\n\nThere has to be room enough in the society as large, as free and as pluralistic as America, to make space for all of us.\n\nWALLACE: Finally, for all of the controversies, this is Easter which has a very joyous meaning. What is your message, your Easter message, for our viewers.\n\nWUERL: The Easter message for every Christian is Christ is risen and that's we say, hallelujah, come to mass. But for the rest of the world, Easter is also a reminder of hope. There is always hope, individually, collectively, societally, we should never give up hope that we can make things better. That's the story of Easter.\n\nFor the believer, it's hallelujah. For everyone else, it should be -- there is hope, there is a possibility to make it a better world.\n\nWALLACE: And it's a beautiful spring and flowers are blooming, and all is right with the world.\n\nCardinal, Thank you so much.\n\nWUERL: You are very welcome. Thank you, Chris.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: The archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.\n\nUp next, a threat to peace in the Pacific. We'll ask our Sunday group how serious is North Korea's drumbeat of war?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCHUCK HAGEL, DEFENSE SECRETARY: ... their very provocative actions. And belligerent tone. It has ratcheted up the danger.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel responding to North Korea's threat of war against the U.S. and South Korea. And, it is time now for our Sunday group. Bill Kristol of \"The Weekly Standard.\" Mara Liasson of National Public Radio. Republican strategist Ed Gillespie and Charles Lane of \"The Washington Post.\" Well, Kim Jong- un, the young leader of North Korea, was quoted Friday as ordering his missile units to be ready to strike the U.S. and South Korea, and this photo was released. Kim meeting with top North Korean generals with a chart showing the trajectory of their missiles, hitting major American cities. Bill, what is Kim's game?\n\nBILL KRISTOL, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Who knows, but it's not good. I mean, they've murdered, starved millions of their own people, that regime, and now -- and they proliferated nuclear weapons. And don't forget, the Israeli strike on the Syrian nuclear weapons plant in 2007, that was given to them by North Korea. So, even if you discount North Korea, oh, they are containable, they are not going to destroy their regime by attacking us, they can proliferate weapons of mass destruction, they can proliferate nuclear weapons and missiles and guess what? Iran and North Korea have this dark relationship and North Korea is short of cash, it could sell these weapons to terrorist groups. So, the threat of North Korea is very real.\n\nWALLACE: And why do you think they are ratcheting up - he is ratcheting up the tension?\n\nKRISTOL: Well, the normal explanation is that it helps stabilize and, you know, helps secure his situation at home -- maybe that is true. But the degree to which, you know, they've created -- he might think he's being playing two games, like his father and his grandfather did, I guess, and, you know, they can pull back at the key moment. But, you know, South Korea and Japan are sitting there, nervous -- he killed South Koreans just about two years ago, three years ago, they killed, what, 45 South Korean sailors, attacked their ship. I mean, Japan, they lobbed a missile over Japan. It's dangerous.\n\nWALLACE: Yeah, let me pick up on that, Mara. Because the North Koreans traditionally, as Bill points out like to bluster and saber- rattle, but even by their standards, this is pretty extreme what is going on now, and that is the concern, that somehow particularly with South Korean, if you've ever been in Seoul, I mean it is an hour's drive from the DMZ. I mean they would be right on the front line. The danger is it gets out of hand.\n\nMARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: The danger is it gets out of hand. And that crazy map behind Kim Jong-un, which showed the lines of the missiles hitting the mainland of the United States and exposing their, quote, battle plans, that might be a fantasy, but they can do tremendous damage to South Korea, and he's announced also that the armistice doesn't hold anymore. They are back in a state of war. Nobody knows exactly what he wants to do. I don't even know if he knows what he wants to do, but yes, it is a really dangerous situation, and I don't think the United States has a clear idea of what to do to stop him.\n\nWALLACE: Well, let's talk, Ed, about the U.S. response. Because first, Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary announced that we are beefing up our missile defense along the border with Alaska and then this week -- in Alaska, again, along the border with Russia, and, then, this week we sent, as you can see there -- a pair of B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, all the way from Missouri to military exercises over South Korea. Ed, sensible reaction by the Pentagon or over-reaction?\n\nED GILLESPIE, FMR. ROMNEY CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: No, I think it's a sensible reaction. And I think in addition to that, it would be good for the administration to not only bolster our own missile defense, but to support Japan and South Korea with missile defense. I think, to Bill's point, they are nervous, understandably, and I think doing anything -- everything we can to reassure them would be helpful, and, obviously, you know, trying to get China to engage in their own region in a way that would be helpful, I think, with Kim Jong-un would be important, too.\n\nWALLACE: I'm going to pick up on China in a second. Your thoughts, though, Chuck about the U.S. response. What we have done so far, what more we can do?\n\nCHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think President Obama's approach to North Korea throughout his presidency has been, essentially, not to rise to the bait, and I think that has been a good approach so far. I think sending the B-2s sent a strong signal.\n\nI think what we are dealing with here is sort of the third generation of a family business over there in North Korea, and the business is building up this whole military structure, building up as Bill suggests, the capability to proliferate. Conducting terrorist activities. People forget that years ago they blew up a whole group of South Korean diplomats in Burma of all places. And the purpose of the family business is through the constant threat, constant belligerence, constant menace, to extract money, concessions, and everything else you can get by blackmailing the other side. Whether the endgame of the family business is to actually go to war in South Korea, I doubt, because I think people are -- need to remember, North Korea would not win that war. At the very least would come out of it very badly damaged. So, I think what we are seeing here is a generation of war hysteria to help control themselves inside and the generation of threats, especially towards this new, more conservative, less concession-minded government in South Korea to see what they can extract. As they have now for 20 years since this nuclear issue began.\n\nWALLACE: You know, one of the concerns here, and that does seem to be different, Bill, is that North Korea seems to be ignoring the warnings from its main, far and away biggest sponsor, China, which had warned the regime and Kim Jong-un not to make these threats against the United States, not to make these threats against South Korea, and yet it proceeded with them. Why would Kim risk alienating the country that literally, you know -- talk about biting the hand that feeds you, that literally feeds its people?\n\nKRISTOL: Well, China never seemed to really have been willing to pull the trigger and stop feeding his people or stop providing other kinds of aid to North Korea, so they've gotten away with this in the past, and the Chinese have been unwilling to risk undermining -- allowing the North Korean regime to be undermined and to fall with the unified Korea. And I think that's dangerous to them. I don't know why, Korea isn't going to invade China, but nonetheless, they want to preserve -- they don't want the East European model of communist regimes falling on their border.\n\nThe U.S., what can we do? We can get serious about missile defense. We spend about 1.5 percent of our defense budget on missile defense. The Obama administration having canceled the ground base interceptors, then restored them just, what, a couple of weeks ago, and said we're going ahead on it. But basically, under both parties, really, but especially under the Democrats, there's been a sort of very haphazard (inaudible) through to President Reagan's announcement 30 years ago. The (inaudible) made a decision, really, and maybe we should try to defend ourselves from nuclear weapons and not just accept them as inevitable. And I think in a post-Cold War world, we don't know, the North Korean regime could be ten or 20 years from now, and they could have many more missiles and many more nuclear weapons and they could be proliferating them. I'm not sure we'll find them or the Israelis will know whether they have proliferated. Don't we want to get serious and spend some real money and really invest in serious missile defense for ourselves and our neighbors?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Ed, the president has kind of flipped on missile defense.\n\nGILLESPIE: Yeah.\n\nWALLACE: Because when he first came in, he pulled back on some of the deployment of anti-missile interceptors. Now, one of his first steps, he and Chuck Hagel at the Pentagon, was to beef up our interceptors system up along the Alaska coast.\n\nGILLESPIE: Yeah, and like I said, they should be commended for that. I'll take one exception, Bill, I'm not -- I think President Bush did make a priority of missile defense, and one of the first things that the Obama administration did was to reverse that, and now they've reversed themselves again, understanding that there was a reason for it, an important strategic reason for it, and I'm glad they reversed themselves. I wish they hadn't reversed themselves in the first place or reverse the policy in the first place, but we have -- this is an example of why we need missile defense, and we need for our friends to have it as well.\n\nWALLACE: All right. We have to take a break here, but when we come back, after this week's historic Supreme Court hearings on same sex marriage, where does the issue stand now?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO: You want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cell phones or the Internet? I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the ability to see the future.\n\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN: Supposed the states said, because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55. Would that be constitutional?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan differing on whether the court should intervene in the issue of same sex marriage. We're back now with the panel. So, at the end of a rare two days of arguments, Bill, where do you think the court is on the constitutional question of same sex marriage, and also, on the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to same sex couples, who have been legally married in their states?\n\nKRISTOL: I mean, it looks as if the court will strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, on sort of federalism grounds, and ...\n\nWALLACE: But it's a state issue, not a federal issue.\n\nKRISTOL: Right, and the federal government in a way is putting a thumb on the scale by preferring traditional marriage to states that -- by preferring states that have chosen traditional marriage over states that have chosen same sex marriage, and it looks as if the court is not going to impose a universal constitutional right to same sex marriage on the nation. And I hope they don't, and I -- I think they won't.\n\nWALLACE: Do you think that they will leave Prop 8 alone and, just, let's say, deny it on procedural grounds, the plaintiff didn't have standing or do you think that they might decide, yes, Prop 8 either stands or falls in California, but that doesn't impact other states.\n\nKRISTOL: Yeah, I can't - I can't tell it, it is hard to read. And maybe others know better than I do what the court is going to do.\n\nWALLACE: All right, we'll go down the list. Down the row here and see. But, one of the points, Mara, that several justices made, is that public opinion is changing so quickly on this issue, both in the polls and, four states in 2012 legalized same sex marriage, that perhaps the court should stay out of it, and leave it to the political process in the states. In that sense, could the supporters of same sex marriage be victims of their own success?\n\nLIASSON: Yes. I think they could and I actually think the best outcome for Democrats and even proponents of same sex marriage is if Prop 8 is upheld in California, but there is no sweeping constitutional finding that same sex marriage is legal all over the country, because ...\n\nWALLACE: Well, if Prop 8 is upheld, that means that same sex marriage is banned.\n\nLIASSON: No, I'm sorry, Prop 8 is -- the lower court ruling is upheld, which means Prop 8 is overturned.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nLIASSON: I'm sorry about that. But if they want to in California, right now they could back and put up Prop 8.2, legalizing same sex marriage and it would probably pass, it is a lot more meaningful and profound to kind of adjudicate divisive social issues by voters and legislators, not unelected justices, and I think that it's going to be more lasting political change if you do it at the ballot box. It also means you're not going to have this huge backlash and I agree with Bill, I don't think the court is going in the direction of legalizing same sex marriage on the national constitutional basis.\n\nWALLACE: Ed, let's talk about the politics of this. You, of course, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, isn't this a problem for the GOP? As we say, public opinion is moving in the direction of support for same sex marriage, especially among young people, 70, 80 percent of all people of all persuasions, under the age of 35, 40, support same sex marriage as a legal right. But the polls show that Republicans still overwhelmingly oppose it, only 27 percent in one poll, I saw, support same sex marriage. So, where does the Republican Party go? You have an awful lot of your base still very much opposes this. But you can see the pendulum swinging for the country.\n\nGILLESPIE: Chris, I don't see the Republican Party or most Republicans, obviously, changing in terms of believing that marriage is between one man and one woman. I do think that in the context of this debate, as in so many other debates, Republicans have been cast in the negative, you know - in the negative to say we are opposing something as opposed to talking about what most Republicans are for. Most Republicans are also for the benefits of marriage in the legal system, that are afforded, the protections like, for example, visitation - hospital visitation rights or survivorship benefits and I think you will hear more Republicans making that point, that we can do those things without having the government sanction same sex marriage.\n\nWALLACE: But looking at the polls, and, particularly, looking at where younger people are going, would you have any problems in 2016, with a Republican Party platform saying that marriage is between a man and a woman?\n\nGILLESPIE: I wouldn't have any problem with that. I think one of the questions is, I believe the platform right now calls for a federal constitutional amendment to ban it. You know, there may be a debate about that.\n\nWALLACE: (inaudible) ban same sex marriage.\n\nGILLESPIE: Yeah, to ban it. I don't think you would ever see the Republican Party platform saying we are in favor of same sex marriage, but there may be a question, because I think to Mara's point, the federalism aspect of this Supreme Court debate has been interesting, and because a lot of conservatives have felt for a long time that Roe was wrongfully decided and imposed ...\n\nWALLACE: Roe v. Wade.\n\nGILLESPIE: Roe v. Wade.\n\nWALLACE: 1973.\n\nGILLESPIE: And that the issue of abortion should have been left to the states, for people to hash out in a more civil manner.\n\nA lot of conservatives found themselves arguing in this instance that the court shouldn't impose a federal mandate that it is legal. So there has been a little bit of a shift I think in terms of Republicans saying we should allow this to be worked out in the states not imposed by courts and not imposed federally. And, it will be interesting to see how that shakes up, because the platform as it is today says a federal constitutional amendment to ban it.\n\nWALLACE: We should point out it isn't just conservatives who feel that Roe was wrong in this particular issue, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a justice of the Supreme Court appointed by Democrats, liberal, very much an abortion rights supporter, says she thinks it was a mistake, because she thought it moved the court too quickly in this direction in a judicial fiat instead of leaving it to the states to work out something that they were working out. Chuck, when you listened to what you three learned colleagues, your fellow justices here on the court, say, your thoughts about the debate this week, where it leaves the issue and the political implications.\n\nLANE: Well, as to the debate, not to sounds Pollyanish, but I thought it was actually refreshing and useful for the whole country to listen to two days of discussion among nine very intelligent people of various views who are not running for office, you know? And who aren't obsessed with the short-term political consequences of these things themselves, but are really sort of wrestling with it in a very serious way, and in that regard I think it was a very, very helpful occasion in the whole debate. Because they've had the sort of guts to go through a whole lot of difficult questions, you know, about, is this really just like interracial marriage? What are the social science consequences and so forth.\n\nBut I think what is crystallizing as a result of this is a distinction is developing between the substance of whether this is a good idea or not, and the process of how we as a country are going to decide. And, in that respect, I do think there is a -- a kind of a tentative consensus on the court that the procedural - the optimum way to handle it is to let the states decide, to give more time to the democratic process to work this thing out as opposed to having the judicial branch sort of slice through the Gordian knot --\n\nWALLACE: But what about the argument? For the sake of argument, what about the argument, look, we don't decide constitutional rights ...\n\nLANE: Right.\n\nWALLACE: ... that way. We don't decide whether schools can be segregated that way. We don't decide interracial marriage that way.\n\nLANE: I think the answer, I've heard from the court was, we're not ready to say this is a constitutional right. That there isn't enough support in the text of the document or in the precedence of this court to say that without same sex marriage every state in the union is violating the Constitution.\n\nWALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next week and don't forget to check out panel-plus. Where our group picks right up with the discussion on our Web site, FoxNewsSunday.com, we'll post the video before noon eastern time, and make sure to follow us on Twitter @FoxnewsSunday.\n\nUp next, our Power Player of the Week.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Of course, this is Easter Sunday. But, it was also 32 years ago, this weekend, a gunman tried to kill Ronald Reagan. Today, a story you have never heard before. About how a doctor saved the president's life with what he believes was some divine help. Here's our Power Player of the Week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDR. SAM SPAGNOLO, GWU & VA MEDICAL CENTER: And they said we need you to come over to the hospital right away.\n\nWALLACE: That was how Dr. Sam Spagnolo learned 32 years ago he was about to take on the case of his life. He was the head of the lung department at George Washington University Hospital. And Ronald Reagan, who had sustained a gunshot to the lung, was in the operating room. SPAGNOLO: The bullet went through here and lodged over here on the inner surface of the lung, so another inch or two and it would have been into the heart.\n\nWALLACE: Spagnolo first saw the president when he was wheeled into the recovery room.\n\nSPAGNOLO: And we put him on the ventilator right away and he was getting some sedation and I stayed there until we finally got him off the ventilator, about 3 o'clock in the morning.\n\nWALLACE: The doctor says Reagan did well in the first couple of days, his condition serious, but not critical, then things changed. Spagnolo kept a diary he's making public for the first time.\n\nSPAGNOLO: Day five, April 3rd, 1981. I was called at home and requested a return to the hospital. I arrived at the presidential suite and asked the nurse in charge what was going on. She told me the president's temperature was almost 104 degrees and he was not looking well. That made all of us a little nervous about which way this was going to go.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): When you said which way this was going to go, was his life is danger?\n\nSPAGNOLO: At that point I thought his life was in danger.\n\nWALLACE: That's got to take your breath away.\n\nSPAGNOLO: It did.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Spagnolo ordered a battery of tests, to check for infection. But the president's medical team resisted.\n\nSPAGNOLO: Things were going a little slower than I'd hoped.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): So, what did you say?\n\nSPAGNOLO: If we don't get movement, I'm not - I'm going to walk off this case.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): The other doctors agreed to the tests, but they found no sign of infection. Still, Spagnolo was convinced that was the problem. And put Reagan on antibiotics. Within 24 hours, his temperature went down.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): Honestly, 30 years later, what do you think would have happened if you had not intervened and given him this broad dose of antibiotics.\n\nSPAGNOLO: He might not have gotten better.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Spagnolo sat by the president's bedside in the morning for the next two weeks, watching TV and listening to his stories. There was no mention of politics.\n\nSPAGNOLO: Day nine, Tuesday, April 7th -- I went to the president's room and spoke with him for 10 to 15 minutes. He looked better and his spirits were good. He continued to tell me various stories at that time about his early days in Hollywood.\n\nWALLACE: Months later the Reagans invited the medical team to the Oval Office to thank them for saving the president's life. Reagan always said his recovery was miraculous. Dr. Spagnolo agrees.\n\nSPAGNOLO: I certainly think somebody was watching over me, all the time, making sure that the thing was going well. I certainly - took any extra help that I could get from the good Lord above.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: I spoke with Nancy Reagan this weekend and asked if she had a message for Dr. Spagnolo. She said please send him a big, big thank you.\n\nAnd that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama debated in Nashville, Tennessee, on Tuesday night. NBC's Tom Brokaw moderated the debate. Here is a transcript of that debate.\n\nSen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain meet in Nashville for their second debate.\n\nBrokaw: Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I'm Tom Brokaw of NBC News. And welcome to this second presidential debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nTonight's debate is the only one with a town hall format. The Gallup Organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the Nashville area to be here with us tonight. And earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates.\n\nFrom all of these questions -- and from tens of thousands submitted online -- I have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy.\n\nNeither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions. And although we won't be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion one month before the election.\n\nEach candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute follow-up. The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite, and attentive, no cheering or outbursts. Those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained.\n\nThe only exception in the hall is right now, as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\nGentlemen?\n\nGentlemen, we want to get under way immediately, if we can. Since you last met at Ole Miss 12 days ago, the world has changed a great deal, and not for the better. We still don't know where the bottom is at this time.\n\nAs you might expect, many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the American economy and, in fact, with global economic conditions.\n\nI understand that you flipped a coin.\n\nAnd, Sen. Obama, you will begin tonight. And we're going to have our first question from over here in Section A from Allen Shaffer.\n\nAllen?\n\nShaffer: With the economy on the downturn and retired and older citizens and workers losing their incomes, what's the fastest, most positive solution to bail these people out of the economic ruin?\n\nObama: Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question. I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.\n\nI think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.\n\nAnd I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Sen. McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.\n\nIt hasn't worked out that way. And so now we've got to take some decisive action.\n\nNow, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. We've got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.\n\nIt means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.\n\nAnd I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But that's only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.\n\nIt means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.\n\nAnd then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Tom. Thank you, Belmont University. And Sen. Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.\n\nAnd, Alan (ph), thank you for your question. You go to the heart of America's worries tonight. Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful. It's our job to fix the problem.\n\nNow, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much. We have to keep Americans' taxes low. All Americans' taxes low. Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.\n\nWe obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington. Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?\n\nWe've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.\n\nYou know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.\n\nIs it expensive? Yes. But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.\n\nI know how the do that, my friends. And it's my proposal, it's not Sen. Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal. But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans. Thank you.\n\nBrokaw: Senator, we have one minute for a discussion here. Obviously the powers of the treasury secretary have been greatly expanded. The most powerful officer in the cabinet now. Hank Paulson says he won't stay on. Who do you have in mind to appoint to that very important post?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Not you, Tom.\n\nBrokaw: No, with good reason.\n\nMcCain: You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans. But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.\n\nA supporter of Sen. Obama's is Warren Buffett [chairman of Berkshire Hathaway]. He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.\n\nI like Meg Whitman [former CEO of eBay and current McCain campaign adviser], she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay. Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.\n\nBut the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.\n\nBrokaw: All right. Sen. McCain -- Sen. Obama, who do you have in mind for treasury secretary?\n\nObama: Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support. But there are other folks out there. The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.\n\nProsperity is not just going to trickle down. We've got to help the middle class.\n\nAnd we've -- you know, Sen. McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Sen. McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.\n\nPart of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.\n\nAnd that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nSen. McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices. But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income. That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, thank you very much.\n\nMay I remind both of you, if I can, that we're operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion, it really is to be confined within about a minute or so.\n\nWe're going to go now, Sen. McCain, to the next question from you from the hall here, and it comes from Oliver Clark, who is over here in section F.\n\nOliver?\n\nClark: Well, Senators, through this economic crisis, most of the people that I know have had a difficult time. And through this bailout package, I was wondering what it is that's going to actually help those people out.\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.\n\nI left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.\n\nBut you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.\n\nBut you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Sen. Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.\n\nAnd you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this. We've got to stop this greed and excess.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change.\n\nMeanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. Sen. Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.\n\nSo this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. But it's not enough. That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.\n\nBut Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it. There were others who took a hike.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you. Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.\n\nIf they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll. If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.\n\nAnd if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.\n\nSo it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action. But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.\n\nNow, I've got to correct a little bit of Sen. McCain's history, not surprisingly. Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.\n\nSen. McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.\n\nI wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman [Ben] Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.\n\nA year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.\n\nAnd Sen. McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.\n\nNow, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Sen. McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill. He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.\n\nAnd I never promoted Fannie Mae. In fact, Sen. McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.\n\nSo -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?\n\nThis is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.\n\nThe secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet. And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, time for a discussion. I'm going to begin with you. Are you saying to Mr. Clark (ph) and to the other members of the American television audience that the American economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that?\n\nObama: No, I am confident about the American economy. But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.\n\nThe problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets. We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.\n\nBut most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, in all candor, do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better?\n\nMcCain: I think it depends on what we do. I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.\n\nMy friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis. Sen. Obama's name was not on that letter.\n\nThe point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy. Americans' workers are the best in the world. They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.\n\nThey're the most innovative. They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters. We're the best importers. They're most effective. They are the best workers in the world.\n\nAnd we've got to give them a chance. They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again. And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. We can do it.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you, Sen. McCain.\n\nWe're going to continue over in Section F, as it turns out.\n\nSen. Obama, this is a question from you from Teresa Finch.\n\nTeresa?\n\nFinch: How can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got -- got us into this global economic crisis?\n\nObama: Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget. If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car.\n\nThat's not what happens in Washington. And you're right. There is a lot of blame to go around.\n\nBut I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.\n\nWhen George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion. It's now over $10 trillion. We've almost doubled it.\n\nAnd so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.\n\nSo here's what I would do. I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.\n\nYou know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.\n\nWe are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our children's future. We've got to have a different energy plan.\n\nWe've got to invest in college affordability. So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts. And what I've proposed, you'll hear Sen. McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.\n\nThe key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests. We've got to put an end to that.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, Theresa (ph), thank you. And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken. And I have been a consistent reformer.\n\nI have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Sen. [Russ] Feingold [D-Wisconsin] on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Sen. Lieberman on trying to address climate change.\n\nI have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Sen. Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform.\n\nAnd so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric. That's really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.\n\nI don't expect you to watch every vote. And you know what you'll find? This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate. I have fought against excessive spending and outrages. I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.\n\nDo you know that Sen. Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? New spending. Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?\n\nHe voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?\n\nI think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.\n\nYou're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.\n\nBrokaw: We've run out of time. We have this one-minute discussion period going on here.\n\nThere are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made. Health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform, what are going to be your priorities in what order? Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: The three priorities were health...\n\nBrokaw: The three -- health care, energy, and entitlement reform: Social Security and Medicare. In what order would you put them in terms of priorities?\n\nMcCain: I think you can work on all three at once, Tom. I think it's very important that reform our entitlement programs.\n\nMy friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today. We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.\n\nI know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. That's my clear record.\n\nWe can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.\n\nMy friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.\n\nAs far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. That's the next issue.\n\nBut we can do them all at once. There's no -- and we have to do them all at once. All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.\n\nBrokaw: I'm trying to play by the rules that you all established. One minute for discussion.\n\nSen. Obama, if you would give us your list of priorities, there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once.\n\nObama: We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize. Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.\n\nEnergy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.\n\nSo we've got to deal with that right away. That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.\n\nAnd we can do it. Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one.\n\nHealth care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.\n\nAnd, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.\n\nBut just one point I want to make, Tom. Sen. McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records.\n\nSen. McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And that's important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.\n\nBut understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Sen. McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.\n\nAnd so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you. That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.\n\nBrokaw: All right, gentlemen, I want to just remind you one more time about time. We're going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we don't get this under control here before too long.\n\nSen. McCain, for you, we have our first question from the Internet tonight. A child of the Depression, 78-year-old Fiorra from Chicago.\n\nSince World War II, we have never been asked to sacrifice anything to help our country, except the blood of our heroic men and women. As president, what sacrifices -- sacrifices will you ask every American to make to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we're now in?\n\nMcCain: Well, Fiorra, I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.\n\nI first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.\n\nI know a lot of them that aren't working. One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.\n\nI believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Sen. Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.\n\nAnd they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.\n\nSo we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America. And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.\n\nAnd some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.\n\nAnd, by the way, I want to go back a second.\n\nLook, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here. We are Americans. We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together.\n\nFrankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, \"I'm sorry, you'll have to wait.\" I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much.\n\nSen. Obama?\n\nObama: You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.\n\nAnd President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \"Go out and shop.\"\n\nThat wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.\n\nAnd so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.\n\nAnd let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.\n\nI believe in the need for increased oil production. We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.\n\nWe're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.\n\nBut each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.\n\nAnd that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.\n\nAnd the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.\n\nThat's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, President Bush, you'll remember, last summer, said that \"Wall Street got drunk.\"\n\nA lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the American consumers got drunk.\n\nHow would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit, specifically, across the board, for this country, not just at the federal level, but as a model for the rest of the country, as well?\n\nObama: Well, I think it starts with Washington. We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, \"Well, you know what? There's easy money out there.\"\n\nIt means -- and I have to, again, repeat this. It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. I mean, Sen. McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.\n\nNow, when Sen. McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.\n\nAnd so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.\n\nI mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.\n\nAnd that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Sen. McCain about an across-the- board freeze.\n\nThat's an example of an unfair burden sharing. That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.\n\nI want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Sen. McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.\n\nThat's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, you know, nailing down Sen. Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.\n\nBut he wants to raise taxes. My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.\n\nYou know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America. The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses. Sen. Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.\n\nSmall businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Sen. Obama's tax policies. You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.\n\nI've got some news, Sen. Obama, the news is bad. So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.\n\nTo giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Sen. Obama's plan calls for. And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again. And let's not raise anybody's taxes.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, we have another question from the Internet.\n\nObama: Tom, can I respond to this briefly? Because...\n\nBrokaw: Well, look, guys, the rules were established by the two campaigns, we worked very hard on this. This will address, I think, the next question.\n\nObama: The tax issue, because I think it's very important. Go ahead.\n\nBrokaw: There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. And we have a question from Langdon (ph) in Ballston Spa, New York, and that's about huge unfunded obligations for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that's in place and then go into a deficit position.\n\nSince the rules are pretty loose here, I'm going to add my own to this one. Instead of having a discussion, let me ask you as a coda to that. Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office? Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.\n\nObama: Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly. We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.\n\nBut I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Sen. McCain, I think the \"Straight Talk Express\" lost a wheel on that one.\n\nSo let's be clear about my tax plan and Sen. McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.\n\nIf you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.\n\nAnd we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.\n\nNow, in contrast, Sen. McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.\n\nHe wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesn't work.\n\nNow, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Sen. McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, two years for a reform of entitlement programs?\n\nMcCain: Sure. Hey, I'll answer the question. Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom. It's just...\n\nBrokaw: And Medicare.\n\nMcCain: ... tough decisions. I want to get to Medicare in a second.\n\nSocial Security is not that tough. We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are. We've got to sit down together across the table. It's been done before.\n\nI saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts. That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.\n\nSen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. I've taken them on. I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.\n\nSo Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher. It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.\n\nMy friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.\n\nLet's not let them fool with it anymore. There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there. So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, \"Fix it for us.\"\n\nNow, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record. Sen. Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That's his record.\n\nWhen he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?\n\nSo let's look at our record. I've fought higher taxes. I have fought excess spending. I have fought to reform government.\n\nLet's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America. And we'll get our economy going again. And our best days are ahead of us.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much. I'm going to stick by my part of the pact and not ask a follow-up here.\n\nThe next question does come from the hall for Sen. McCain. It comes from Section C over here, and it's from Ingrid Jackson.\n\nIngrid?\n\nJackson: Sen. McCain, I want to know, we saw that Congress moved pretty fast in the face of an economic crisis. I want to know what you would do within the first two years to make sure that Congress moves fast as far as environmental issues, like climate change and green jobs?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you. Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.\n\nBut when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue. I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.\n\nAnd I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. That's the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.\n\nNow, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Sen. Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.\n\nLook, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nAnd -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Sen. Obama has opposed that.\n\nWe can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.\n\nWe can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.\n\nAnd it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.\n\nIt can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.\n\nAnd we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.\n\nAnd that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Sen. McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.\n\nBut this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Sen. McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.\n\nWhat Sen. McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.\n\nSo it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.\n\nOne last point I want to make on energy. Sen. McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.\n\nSo what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem. And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.\n\nWe're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.\n\nWe've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.\n\nBrokaw: Gentlemen, you may not have noticed, but we have lights around here. They have red and green and yellow and they are to signal...\n\nObama: I'm just trying to keep up with John.\n\nMcCain: Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.\n\nBrokaw: All right, Senator.\n\nHere's a follow-up to that, one-minute discussion. It's a simple question.\n\nMcCain: Sure.\n\nBrokaw: Should we fund a Manhattan-like project that develops a nuclear bomb to deal with global energy and alternative energy or should we fund 100,000 garages across America, the kind of industry and innovation that developed Silicon Valley?\n\nMcCain: I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate. I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.\n\nBy the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.\n\nYou know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.\n\nI vote against them, my friends. I vote against them. But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.\n\nThat's fundamental economics. We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.\n\nAnd as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. Sen. Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.\n\nAnd I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave. Thanks.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you very much, Senator.\n\nNext question for you, Sen. Obama, and it comes from the E section over here and it's from Lindsey Trella.\n\nLindsey?\n\nTrella: Senator, selling health care coverage in America as the marketable commodity has become a very profitable industry.\n\nDo you believe health care should be treated as a commodity?\n\nObama: Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care. It is breaking family budgets. I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.\n\nIf you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.\n\nSo one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.\n\nSo here's what I would do. If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.\n\nAnd we're going to do it by investing in prevention. We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.\n\nIf you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Sen. McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.\n\nSo what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.\n\nIn fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.\n\nThat, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need. We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you for the question. You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces. Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.\n\nAnd we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. Let's have community health centers. Let's have walk-in clinics. Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.\n\nBut what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Sen. Obama. As you notice, he starts talking about government. He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.\n\nIf you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Sen. Obama will fine you. Will fine you. That's remarkable. If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Sen. Obama will fine you.\n\nI want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit. They can take it anywhere, across state lines. Why not? Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America? Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.\n\nAnd if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.\n\nYou know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself. But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.\n\nObviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. Of course they all want to do that. We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it. We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.\n\nBrokaw: Quick discussion. Is health care in America a privilege, a right, or a responsibility?\n\nSen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member. And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.\n\nBut government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about. But it is certainly my responsibility. It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility. American citizens understand that. Employers understand that.\n\nBut they certainly are a little nervous when Sen. Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined. And, by the way, Sen. Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be. Perhaps we might find that out tonight.\n\nObama: Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.\n\nBrokaw: Privilege, right or responsibility. Let's start with that.\n\nObama: Well, I think it should be a right for every American. In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.\n\nSo let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Sen. McCain through a lot of stuff out there.\n\nNumber one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You'll still have choice of doctor. There's no mandate involved.\n\nSmall businesses are not going to have a mandate. What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.\n\nNow, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.\n\nAnd when Sen. McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.\n\nNow, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.\n\nAnd the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.\n\nThat's how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.\n\nAnd in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.\n\nThat is a fundamental difference that I have with Sen. McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. That's what we've been going through for the last eight years. It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.\n\nBrokaw: Sen., we want to move on now. If we'd come back to the hall here, we're going to shift gears here a little bit and we're going to go to foreign policy and international matters, if we can...\n\nMcCain: I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?\n\nBrokaw: Phil Elliott is over here in this section, and Phil Elliott has a question for Sen. McCain.\n\nPhil?\n\nElliott: Yes. Sen. McCain, how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation's ability to act as a peacemaker in the world?\n\nMcCain: Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well. And that is one of the challenges that America faces.\n\nBut having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism. I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.\n\nBut the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world. My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.\n\nSo we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers. But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.\n\nAnd that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.\n\nAnd I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.\n\nSen. Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.\n\nWe don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, the economic constraints on the U.S. military action around the world.\n\nObama: Well, you know, Sen. McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand. It's true. There are some things I don't understand.\n\nI don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.\n\nThat was Sen. McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.\n\nWhen Sen. McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.\n\nThat was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.\n\nSo one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.\n\nBut it's also put an enormous strain on our budget. We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Sen. McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.\n\nWe're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.\n\nAnd we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Sen. McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. We are a force of good in the world. But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.\n\nAnd the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.\n\nThat's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Sen. McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy. It has not worked for America.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama, let me ask you if -- let's see if we can establish tonight the Obama doctrine and the McCain doctrine for the use of United States combat forces in situations where there's a humanitarian crisis, but it does not affect our national security.\n\nTake the Congo, where 4.5 million people have died since 1998, or take Rwanda in the earlier dreadful days, or Somalia.\n\nWhat is the Obama doctrine for use of force that the United States would send when we don't have national security issues at stake?\n\nObama: Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.\n\nIf we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?\n\nIf we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.\n\nSo when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.\n\nAnd so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.\n\nBut understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world. We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time. That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.\n\nLet's take the example of Darfur just for a moment. Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nWe could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead. And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, the McCain Doctrine, if you will.\n\nMcCain: Well, let me just follow up, my friends. If we had done what Sen. Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which Gen. [David] Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.\n\nThere was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Sen. Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.\n\nThe United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.\n\nBut it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.\n\nWe went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.\n\nIn Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldn't. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.\n\nSo you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way. And, again, I know those situations.\n\nI've been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.\n\nAnd I may have to make those tough decisions. But I won't take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, thank you very much.\n\nNext question for Sen. Obama, it comes from the F section and is from Katie Hamm. Katie?\n\nHamm: Should the United States respect Pakistani sovereignty and not pursue al Qaeda terrorists who maintain bases there, or should we ignore their borders and pursue our enemies like we did in Cambodia during the Vietnam War?\n\nObama: Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan. I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.\n\nSo what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.\n\nThey are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. They're stronger now than at any time since 2001. And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.\n\nThey are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end. So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.\n\nBut I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.\n\nWhat I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.\n\nAnd if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security priority.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Well, Katie (ph), thank you.\n\nYou know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick. Sen. Obama likes to talk loudly.\n\nIn fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan. Remarkable.\n\nYou know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion.\n\nWhen you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.\n\nNow, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaeda, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.\n\nNow, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaeda and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.\n\nNow, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq. And that is to get the support of the people.\n\nWe need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.\n\nAnd by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.\n\nObama: Tom, just a...\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain...\n\nObama: ... just a quick follow-up on this. I think...\n\nMcCain: If we're going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.\n\nBrokaw: No, I know. So but I think we get at it...\n\nMcCain: It'd be fine with me. It'd be fine with me.\n\nBrokaw: ... if I can, with this question.\n\nObama: Then let's have one.\n\nBrokaw: All right, let's have a follow-up.\n\nMcCain: It'd be fine with me.\n\nObama: Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.\n\nBrokaw: I'm just the hired help here, so, I mean...\n\nObama: You're doing a great job, Tom.\n\nLook, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said. Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan. Sen. McCain continues to repeat this.\n\nWhat I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.\n\nNow, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.\n\nNow, Sen. McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.\n\nMcCain: Thank you very much.\n\nObama: Sen. McCain, this is the guy who sang, \"Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,\" who called for the annihilation of North Korea. That I don't think is an example of \"speaking softly.\"\n\nThis is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, \"Next up, Baghdad.\"\n\nSo I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly. And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties. We were not promoting democracy.\n\nThis is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.\n\nMcCain: And, Tom, if -- if we're going to go back and forth, I then -- I'd like to have equal time to go -- to respond to...\n\nBrokaw: Yes, you get the...\n\nMcCain: ... to -- to -- to...\n\nBrokaw: ... last word here, and then we have to move on.\n\nMcCain: Not true. Not true. I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didn't think so.\n\nI understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way. I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this. I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.\n\nBut the point is that I know how to handle these crises. And Sen. Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words. I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends. I'll get him. I know how to get him.\n\nI'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it. But I'm not going to telegraph my punches, which is what Sen. Obama did. And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.\n\nAnd we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.\n\nBrokaw: Can I get a quick response from the two of you about developments in Afghanistan this week? The senior British military commander, who is now leading there for a second tour, and their senior diplomatic presence there, Sherard Cowper-Coles, who is well known as an expert in the area, both have said that we're failing in Afghanistan.\n\nThe commander said we cannot win there. We've got to get it down to a low level insurgency, let the Afghans take it over. Cowper-Coles said what we need is an acceptable dictator.\n\nIf either of you becomes president, as one of you will, how do you reorganize Afghanistan's strategy or do you? Briefly, if you can.\n\nObama: I'll be very brief. We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.\n\nGen. [David] McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.\n\nWe're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, \"You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary.\"\n\nI don't think he has to be a dictator. And we want a democracy in Afghanistan. But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, briefly.\n\nMcCain: Gen. Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.\n\nAnd I've had conversations with him. It is the same overall strategy. Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Sen. Obama is correct on.\n\nWe have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.\n\nBut most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Sen. Obama said wouldn't work, couldn't work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq.\n\nHe still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.\n\nAnd once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.\n\nSo I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again. We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, this question is for you from the Internet. It's from Alden in Hewitt, Texas.\n\nHow can we apply pressure to Russia for humanitarian issues in an effective manner without starting another Cold War?\n\nMcCain: First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.\n\nBut have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.\n\nNow, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin. I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B. He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks. He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.\n\nI said before, watch Ukraine. Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.\n\nWe've got to show moral support for Georgia.\n\nWe've got to show moral support for Ukraine. We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.\n\nWe have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.\n\nAnd so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior. Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.\n\nBut the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama.\n\nMcCain: It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama? We're winding down, so if we can keep track of the time.\n\nObama: Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency. And for the most part I agree with Sen. McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.\n\nBut we can't just provide moral support. We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites. But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.\n\nThe other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners. We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.\n\nAnd you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation. So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.\n\nWe haven't been doing enough of that. We tend to be reactive. That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Sen. McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.\n\nWe've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.\n\nAnd one last point I want to make about Russia. Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia. If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world. That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.\n\nBrokaw: This requires only a yes or a no. Ronald Reagan famously said that the Soviet Union was the evil empire. Do you think that Russia under Vladimir Putin is an evil empire?\n\nObama: I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain?\n\nMcCain: Maybe.\n\nBrokaw: Maybe.\n\nMcCain: Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things. If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War. If I say no, it ignores their behavior.\n\nObviously energy is going to be a big, big factor. And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe. And that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest.\n\nBut the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.\n\nBrokaw: All right. We're going to try to get in two more questions, if we can. So we have to move along. Over in section A, Terry Shirey -- do I have that right, Terry?\n\nShirey: Senator, as a retired Navy chief, my thoughts are often with those who serve our country. I know both candidates, both of you, expressed support for Israel.\n\nIf, despite your best diplomatic efforts, Iran attacks Israel, would you be willing to commit U.S. troops in support and defense of Israel? Or would you wait on approval from the U.N. Security Council?\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Terry (ph). And thank you for your service to the country.\n\nI want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer. And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend. Thanks for serving.\n\nLet -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council. I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.\n\nAnd our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat. It's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel. It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.\n\nIf Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too. The tensions will be ratcheted up.\n\nWhat would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?\n\nNow, Sen. Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. That's what he stated, again, a matter of record.\n\nI want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior. And I think we can do that.\n\nI think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. Obama?\n\nObama: Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.\n\nWe cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.\n\nAnd so it's unacceptable. And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.\n\nAnd we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.\n\nIt is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.\n\nAnd that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them.\n\nNow, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.\n\nIf you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.\n\nNow, it may not work. But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.\n\nWhen President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.\n\nWe've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.\n\nBrokaw: All right, gentlemen, we've come to the last question.\n\nAnd you'll both be interested to know this comes from the Internet and it's from a state that you're strongly contesting, both of you. It's from Peggy in Amherst, New Hampshire. And it has a certain Zen-like quality, I'll give you a fair warning.\n\nShe says, \"What don't you know and how will you learn it?\"\n\nSen. Obama, you get first crack at that.\n\nObama: My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do. And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.\n\nBut, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect. It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.\n\nBut here's what I do know. I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity. I came from very modest means. I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.\n\nDespite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.\n\nThe same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.\n\nAnd the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation? Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.\n\nWages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.\n\nAnd we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.\n\nWe need fundamental change. That's what's at stake in this election. That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.\n\nBut we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.\n\nThank you.\n\nBrokaw: Sen. McCain, you get the last word. Sen. Obama had the opening. You're last up.\n\nMcCain: Well, thank you, Tom. And I think what I don't know is what all of us don't know, and that's what's going to happen both here at home and abroad.\n\nThe challenges that we face are unprecedented. Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation.\n\nThere are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans.\n\nSo what I don't know is what the unexpected will be. But I have spent my whole life serving this country. I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business. My mother basically raised our family.\n\nI know what it's like in dark times. I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times. I know what it's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times.\n\nI know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.\n\nThat's what America's all about. I believe in this country. I believe in its future. I believe in its greatness. It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.\n\nAnd I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.\n\nThank you, Tom.\n\nBrokaw: Thank you very much, Sen. McCain.\n\nThat concludes tonight's debate from here in Nashville. We want to thank our hosts here at Belmont University in Nashville and the Commission on Presidential Debates. And you're in my way of my script there, if you will move.\n\nIn addition to everything else, there is one more presidential debate on Wednesday, October 15, at Hofstra University in New York, moderated by my friend, Bob Schieffer of \"CBS News.\"\n\nThank you, Sen. McCain. Thank you, Sen. Obama. Good night, everyone, from Nashville. iReport.com: Who do you think won the debate?\n\nAll About U.S. Presidential Election \u2022 John McCain \u2022 Barack Obama"

    "text": "Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit\n\nThursday, March 22, 2007\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact: Ben LaBolt\n\nWASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson urging them to immediately convene a homeownership preservation summit with key stakeholders to fight foreclosures driven by growth in the subprime mortgage market.\n\nThe text of the letter is below:\n\nDear Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson,\n\nThere is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures. Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge.\n\nWe cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes. And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly.\n\nWorking together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger. Rampant foreclosures are in nobody\u2019s interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets.\n\nThe summit should consider best practice loan marketing, underwriting, and origination practices consistent with the recent (and overdue) regulators\u2019 Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling, voluntary loan restructuring, limited forbearance, and other possible workout strategies. I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following:\n\nWhat standards investors should require of lenders, particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates.\n\nHow to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty.\n\nHow to support independent community-based-organizations to provide counseling and work-out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical.\n\nHow to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage.\n\nHow to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability, transparency, non-discrimination, genuine consumer value, and competitive returns.\n\nHow to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability.\n\nOf course, the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices, or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short-term post-purchase interventions in certain cases. My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation.\n\nNevertheless, a consortium of industry-related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at-risk homeowners and neighborhoods, even before Congress has had an opportunity to act. There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy. Please don\u2019t let this opportunity pass us by.\n\nSincerely,\n\nU.S. Senator Barack Obama"

    "text": "NEW YORK, June 9, 2013\u0097 -- A rush transcript of \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" airing on Sunday morning, June 9, 2013 on ABC News is below. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning and welcome to \"This Week.\" Watching everything.\n\n(START VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSAWYER: America's phone records, but also internet searches are under surveillance.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: A secret government program tracking our phones, casting a wide net across the internet.\n\n(START VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: I want to be very clear, nobody is listening to your telephone calls.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Has this protected national security?\n\n(START VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROGERS: This program was used to stop a terrorist attack.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: At what cost to personal privacy?\n\n(START VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPAUL: I am appalled. It's a violation of the Bill of Rights.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: This morning, we cover the controversy from all angles. The reporter who broke the story, Glen Greenwald. The Senator who sounded the alarm, Mark Udall, and the Committee Chairs who approved the program, Senator Diane Feinstein, and Congressman Mike Rogers. Plus our Powerhouse Roundtable on that, and all the weeks politics with ABC's George Will and Matthew Dowd, Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman from the New York Times, Congressman Keith Ellison, and Great Van Susteren from Fox News.\n\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Reporting from ABC News Headquarters, George Stephanopoulos.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Hello again. The secret struggle to balance national security and individual liberty broke out into open this week, after a series of blockbuster revelations, starting in The Guardian newspaper. We learned that the government has the capacity to track virtually every American phone call, and to scoop up impossibly vast quantities of data across the Internet.\n\nAnd our first guest is The Guardian columnist getting these scoops, Glenn Greenwald. Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Greenwald. You are really on a roll. You broke another story yesterday showing the scale of the data collection programs. In March 2013, you report the government collected 97 billion pieces of data, almost all of it from outside the U.S. What's the key finding here?\n\nGREENWALD: There are two key findings. One is that there are members of the Congress who have responsibility for oversight, for checking the people who run this vast secret apparatus of spying to make sure they are not abusing their power. These people in Congress have continuously asked for the NSA to provide basic information about how many Americans they are spying on, how many conversations and telephone and chats of -- of Americans they are intercepting, and the NSA continuously tells them, we don't have the capability to tell you that, to even give you a rough estimate.\n\nSo what these documents that we published show, that were marked top-secret to prevent the American people from learning about them, was that the NSA keeps extremely precise statistics, all the data that the senators amassed where that the NSA has falsely claimed does not exist. And the other thing that it does, as you said, is it indicates just how vast and massive the NSA is in terms of sweeping up all forms of communication around the globe, including domestically.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You also drew new criticism yesterday from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He called the disclosures reckless, said the rush to publish has created significant misimpressions and added that the articles are filled with inaccuracies. Your response to that?\n\nGREENWALD: Every single time any major media outlet reports on something that the government is hiding, that political officials don't want people to know, such as the fact that they are collecting the phone records of all Americans, regardless of any suspicion of wrongdoing? The people in power do exactly the same thing. They attack the media as the messenger and they try and discredit the story. This has been going back decades, ever since the Pentagon Papers were released by the New York Times, and political officials said, you are endangering national security.\n\nThe only thing we've endangered is the reputation of the people in power who are building this massive spying apparatus without any accountability who are trying to hide from the American people what it is that they are doing. There is no national security harm from letting people know that they are collecting all phone records, that they are tapping into the Internet, that they are planning massive cyber attacks both foreign and -- and even domestic. These are things that the American people have a right to know. The only thing being damaged is the credibility of political officials and they way they exercise power in the dark.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: One of the things you reported is that the government has, quote, \"direct access\" to the servers of massive internet firms, like Google and Microsoft and Facebook, and all the companies have come out and denied it. You see Google saying, \"The U.S. government does not have direct access or a backdoor to the information stored in our data centers.\" Similar statements from Facebook and Apple. And Mr. Clapper also said, \"The U.S. government does not unilaterally obtain information.\" Now, I take it there could be some semantic word games being played here. What's your understanding about what is actually happening? Because it does appear that they don't have direct access to the servers.\n\nGREENWALD: Well, our story was very clear. What we said was that, and -- and we presented it as the story from the start, was that we have top secret NSA documents that claim that there is a new program called The PRISM Program, in place since 2007 that provides, in the words of the NSA's own documents, direct collection, directly from the servers of these companies. We then went to all of those companies named, and they said no, we don't provide direct access to our servers, so there was a conflict, which is what we reported, that the NSA claims that they have direct access, the companies deny it.\n\nClearly, there are all kinds of negotiations taking place and all kinds of agreements that have been reached between these internet companies that store massive amounts of communication data about people around the world, and the government. We should have this debate out in the open. Let these companies that collect massive amounts of information about people, and the government, resolve this discrepancy in public. Tell us what it is exactly that these companies are turning over to the government, and what kinds of capabilities the government is wanting to access? So we reported these discrepancies precisely because we want them -- those parties to resolve it in -- in public, in sunlight, and-- and let people decide whether or not that's the kind of country they want to live in when -- when the government can -- can get this massive amount of information.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The DNI spokesman also said that a crimes report has been filed by the National Security Agency. Have you been contacted by the FBI or any federal law enforcement official yet?\n\nGREENWALD: No. And -- and any time they would like to speak to me, I'll be more than happy to speak to them, and I will tell them that there is this thing called the Constitution, and the very First Amendment of which guarantees a free press. As an American citizen, I have every right, and even the obligation as a journalist to tell my fellow citizens and -- and our readers what it is that the government is doing, that they don't want people in the United States to know about. And I'm happy to talk to them at any time, and the attempt to intimidate journalists and sources with these constant threats of investigation aren't going to work.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You described your source as a reader of yours who trusted how you would handle the materials. The source has also been described as a career government official, who was concerned about these programs. A former prosecutor called the source a double-agent. I know you're not going to reveal the source, obviously, but what more can you tell us about the individual's motivations?\n\nGREENWALD: Well, first of all, I am not going to confirm that there is only one individual, there could be one or more than one. But, let me first make this point, because I think this is so critical, because every time there is a whistle-blower, somebody who exposes government wrongdoing, the tactic of the government is to try and demonize them as a traitor. They risk their careers, and their lives, and their liberty. Because what they were seeing being done in secret, inside the United States government is so alarming, and so pernicious that they simply want one thing.\n\nAnd that is for the American people, at least to learn about what this massive spying apparatus is, and what the capabilities are, so that we can have an open, honest debate about whether that's the kind of country that we want to live in. And if the people decide that they -- yes, they do want the government knowing everything about them, intervening in all of their communications, monitoring them, keeping dossiers on them, then so be it. But at least we should have that debate openly and democratically. Unfortunately, since the government hides virtually everything that they do at the threat of criminal prosecution, the only way for us to learn about them is through these courageous whistle-blowers who deserve our praise and gratitude and not imprisonment and prosecution.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, should we be expecting more revelations from you?\n\nGREENWALD: You should.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Glenn Greenwald, thanks very much.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Now to the senator who says he did everything short of leaking classified information to shine a light on these surveillance programs. Here is Mark Udall on the Senate floor more than two years ago.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUDALL: The intelligence community can target individuals who have no connection to terrorist organizations. They can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And Senator Udall joins us from Colorado this morning. Thank you for joining us, Senator. Is everything we're learning this week consistent with what you knew then?\n\nUDALL: It is, George, and as you pointed out, I tried to draw attention to what was happening over two years ago. I am not happy that we've had leaks and these leaks are concerning, but I think it's an opportunity now to have a discussion about the limits of surveillance, how we create transparency, and above all, how we protect Americans' privacy.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, what is your main concern here? Because the president has come out and said that that the programs are approved by Congress, overseen by the courts, and carefully constrained. Here he was on Friday.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: They are very focused, and in the abstract, you can complain about big brother and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You don't believe the right balance has been struck?\n\nUDALL: I don't. My main concern is Americans don't know the extent to which they are being surveilled, George. We hear this term metadata, which has to do with when you make calls, where you make calls to, who you're talking to. I think that's private information, and I think if the government is gathering that, the American people ought to know it, we ought to have a discussion about it, and frankly, I think we ought to reopen the Patriot Act and put some limits on the amount of data that the National Security Administration is collecting.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What kind of limits exactly? Because as the president pointed out, no one is listening to phone calls here, and they are not allowed to continue the targeting of any individual unless they have probable cause, unless they have developed some information that would give them a reason to continue with tracking.\n\nUDALL: My concern is, look, you know through a contract with your company that they're going to collect this data, but the phone company can't arrest you, prosecute you, put you in jail. And metadata, although it sounds simple and it sounds innocuous, can lead to a lot of additional information. I just draw the line a little bit differently than the president does. We do need to remember, we're in a war against terrorists, and terrorism remains a real threat, but I also think we have to cue to the Bill of Rights, and the Fourth Amendment, which prevents unlawful searches and seizures, ought to be important to us. It ought to remain sacred, and there's got to be a balance here. That is what I'm aiming for. Let's have the debate, let's be transparent, let's open this up. I don't think the American public knows the extent or knew the extent to which they were being surveilled and their data was being collected.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator, the president has said that this has been fully debated and authorized by the Congress.\n\nUDALL: It has been, George, but in a limited way, if I might make that point, and that's why I want to reopen the Patriot Act, I think now that this information is more available. I certainly have a lot of Coloradans say to me they are uncomfortable with this, they want to know more. That's my point, is let's have a debate here, let's look at what is really happening. It's what I was trying to draw attention to two years ago. Millions of records every day being accumulated, makes me uneasy. I think it's a violation of our privacy. Let's take a further look at this.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think that the administration has been straight with the Congress in their testimonies?\n\nUDALL: You know, in general, I do. And look, this is the law, but the way the law is being interpreted has really concerned me. The law has been interpreted in a secret way. That's what I've been calling for, is let's have full disclosure of how this law is being applied. This isn't a scandal, but this is deeply concerning to me and a lot of Americans, and frankly a lot of my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And do you believe, though, that the program has been effective? We had Chairman Mike Rogers coming up saying, who said that this program has helped stop terrorist attacks, and (inaudible) reported that the subway, the attempted subway plot in New York subways in 2009 could have been stopped by this program.\n\nUDALL: George, I am not convinced, and by the way, there are two programs that are being discussed. There is one the so-called PRISM program, Article 702 in the law, and it's been very effective. It surveils foreigners, grabs content, photographs, emails. The 215 provisions which are collecting all the metadata, I am not convinced that it's uniquely valuable intelligence that we could not have generated in other ways. So I know these claims are being made, but that's all the more reason to have a debate, to share this information and to determine whether or not we ought to be collecting millions of records every day of Americans' phone calls. It's just to me a violation of our privacy, particularly if it's done in ways that we don't know about.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Udall, thanks for your time this morning.\n\nUDALL: Hey, George, thanks for having me on.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get a response now from the chairs of the intelligence committees, Democrat Dianne Feinstein from the Senate and Republican Mike Rogers from the House. And Senator Feinstein, let me begin with you. You heard Mr. Greenwald and Senator Udall right there. They believe that the balance between privacy and national security is out of whack with these programs. Your response.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, of course, balance is a difficult thing to actually identify what it is, but I can tell you this: These programs are within the law. The business records section is reviewed by a federal judge every 90 days. It should be noted that the document that was released that was under seal, which reauthorized the program for another 90 days, came along with a second document that placed and discussed the strictures on the program. That document was not released.\n\nSo here's what happens with that program. The program is essentially walled off within the NSA. There are limited numbers of people who have access to it. The only thing taken, as has been correctly expressed, is not content of a conversation, but the information that is generally on your telephone bill, which has been held not to be private personal property by the Supreme Court.\n\nIf there is strong suspicion that a terrorist outside of the country is trying to reach someone on the inside of the country, those numbers then can be obtained. If you want to collect content on the American, then a court order is issued.\n\nSo, the program has been used. Two cases have been declassified. One of them is the case of David Headley, who went to Mumbai, to the Taj hotel, and scoped it out for the terrorist attack.\n\nThe second is Najibullah Zazi, who lived in Colorado, who made the decision that he was going to blow up a New York subway, who went to a beauty wholesale supply place, bought enough hydrogen peroxide to make bombs, was surveilled by the FBI for six months, traveled to go to New York, to meet with a number of other people who were going to carry out this attack with him, and were arrested by the FBI, who has pled guilty and in federal prison.\n\nHere is the point. And this is why this is so difficult. I flew over World Trade Center going to Senator Lautenberg's funeral, and in the distance was the Statue of Liberty. And I thought of those bodies jumping out of that building, hitting the canopy. Part of our obligation is keeping Americans safe. Human intelligence isn't going to do it, because you can't -- it's a different culture. It is a fanaticism that isn't going to come forward. And so, this kind of strict, strictly overseen -- it's overseen by the Justice Department, by inspectors general, by audits, by a 90-day review, by the court, is looked at as a method. I'm very happy if there's a better way, we will certainly look at it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let me bring that to Congressman Rogers, because you also said you believe these programs are effective, Mr. Chairman.\n\nROGERS: I do.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But what about this idea, raised by Senator Udall, that you reopen the Patriot Act, and put more limits on particularly the phone record collection program? Because he says that that hasn't helped. That is his suspicion, at least.\n\nROGERS: Well, I can tell you, in the Zazi case in New York, it's exactly the program that was used. And remember, all of these programs, this is really important, George, I mean, really important. They are not -- the National Security Agency does not listen to Americans' phone calls and it is not reading Americans' emails. None of these programs allow that. As a matter of fact, the Patriot Act, part of that 702 says it's expressly prohibited by law that you can read and wholly surveil domestic e-mail traffic in the United States. So the inflammatory nature of the comments does not fit with what Dianne and I know this program really does. And let's just talk about the phone records just real quickly. What this is, and the reason this happened is after 9/11, we realized there was a big hole in our ability to fully identify all of the players in that terrorist plot. And one of it was by the fact that these business records, the phone billing information, is destroyed by these companies. They can't, expense-wise, it's really difficult for them to hold them. So this is what happened. The court said, put all of that information in a box and hold that information, and when you want to access that information, you have to use this very specific court-ordered approval process, which means it has to be a foreign person believed to be on a foreign land. So some notion that they can see a name that even comes out of that -- by the way, this is important -- no name comes out of that search. So even if they get a number, it doesn't have a name on it. This then allows them to do further investigation.\n\nBut the number of times it's accessed is very -- it is a fraction of a fraction, number one. And number two, no one can data mine that information. That is what's so frustrating to those of us who know this program.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But that's what I was just going to get to. Both of you know so much more than any other Americans. One of the things you heard from Senator Udall is the desire for more public information. Now, he believes that the administration hasn't been misleading generally the committee and the public, but I want to play an exchange, it was in the Intelligence Committee in March, when James Clapper was questioned by your colleague, Senator Wyden.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. RON WYDEN, D-OREGON: Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?\n\nJAMES CLAPPER, DNI: No, sir.\n\nWYDEN: It does not?\n\nCLAPPER: Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Feinstein, I have to confess, I have a hard time squaring that answer with what we learned this week.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, I think this is very hard. There is no more direct or honest person than Jim Clapper, and I think both Mike and I know that. You can misunderstand the question. This is one of the dilemmas of talking about it. He could have thought the question had content or something, but it is true that this is a wide collection of phone records, as Mike said. No name, no content. But the number to number, the length of time, the kind of thing that's on the telephone bill, and we have to deal with that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, what do we do going forward? Senator McCain has said, and we heard Senator Udall as well, that maybe there should be a public hearing on this program and the range of the programs that are surveilling, that includes some surveillance of some data from Americans. Are you open to that, Senator Feinstein? And Chairman Rogers, you comment as well.\n\nFEINSTEIN: Yeah, I am open to it. And I have to think about this. We had an intelligence committee meeting on Thursday, which I opened up to everybody and 27 senators came. You know, we informed them that every senator, the material is available. They can come and see it.\n\nOne of the structures of highly classified with no stuff is no staff. I think that should be changed so that intelligence committee staff can come in with the member and go over and review the material.\n\nBut we have had lots of hearings on this. And I think Senator Wyden knows this and has been respectful of it.\n\nAnd I'm open to doing a hearing every month if that's necessary. And I'm open to doing to doing an opening hearing now.\n\nHere's the rub, the instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks is all classified, that's what's so hard about this. So that we can't actually go in there and other than the two that have been released give the public an actual idea of people that have been saved, attacks that have been prevented, that kind of thing.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chairman Rogers?\n\nROGERS: You know, George, one of the things that we're charged with is keeping America safe and keeping our civil liberties and privacy intact. I think we have done both in this particular case. And the problem with this is, if you tell our adversaries and enemies in the counterterrorism fight exactly how we conduct business, they are not going to business the same ever again. It makes it more difficult.\n\nAnd so each one of these programs -- and I think the Zazi case is so important, because that's one you can specifically show that this was the key piece that allowed us to stop a bombing in the New York Subway system.\n\nBut these programs, that authorized by the court by the way, only focused on non-United States persons overseas, that gets lost in this debate, are pieces of the puzzle. And you have to have all of the pieces of the puzzle to try to put it together. That's what we found went wrong in 9/11.\n\nAnd we didn't have all of the pieces of the puzzle, we found out subsequently, to the Boston bombings, either. And so had we had more pieces of the puzzle you can stop these things before they happen.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, we're just about -- sorry, we're just about out of time. I just want a quick answer from each of you on this. We saw that a crimes investigation has been opened. Is it fair to say that both of you believe that this investigation should be pursued and the source, if found, should be prosecuted?\n\nROGERS: I absolutely believe that someone did not have authorization to release this information. And why that's so important, George, is because they didn't have all of the information. I know your reported that you interviewed, Greenwald, says that he's got it all and now is an expert on the program. He doesn't have a clue how this thing works. Nether did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous.\n\nI argue that there's other methods. He could come to the committees, if they had concern. We have IGs that they can go to in a classified way if they have concern. Taking a very sensitive classified program that targets foreign person on foreign lands, and putting just enough out there to be dangerous, is dangerous to us, it's dangerous to our national security and it violates the oath of which that person took.

It is --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Obama!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love you back. It is good to be here. (Applause.)\n\nI want to say thank you to the Thunder for hosting us here today. (Applause.)

So I want to give a special shout-out to the new seniors, class of 2014. (Applause.) You are aware that you\u2019re not finished yet. (Laughter.) Senior year, that\u2019s sometimes tempting. I want you all to stay focused.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, I have been --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Happy birthday, Mr. President!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) It was my birthday two days ago. (Laughter.) Got some singers here.\n\nAUDIENCE: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, Mr. President. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) I am now 52, and Michelle says that I don\u2019t look a day over 51. (Laughter.)\n\nSo over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been visiting towns all across the country, talking about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class -- a national strategy to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in the 21st century economy.\n\nAnd I think people in Arizona especially understand the challenges that are out there, because for the past four and a half years, together, we fought our way back from a devastating recession that cost millions of jobs for Americans. A lot of folks lost their homes; a lot of folks lost their savings. And what the recession showed was the long erosion of middle-class security that had been taking place for decades.\n\nBut we fought back. We took on a broken health care system. We took on a housing market that was in free fall. We invested in new technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We changed a tax code that had become tilted a little bit too much in favor of the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families. (Applause.) We saved the auto industry. We\u2019ve now got GM that plans to hire a thousand new workers right next door in Chandler to make sure we\u2019re building some of the best cars in the world right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nOur businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the past 41 months. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Our exports are way up. We produce more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anybody else. Health care costs have been growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are coming down at the fastest rate in 60 years. So we\u2019re making progress. (Applause.)\n\nSo thanks to the efforts of a lot of people like you, we\u2019ve cleared away the rubble of the financial crisis. We\u2019re starting to lay the foundation for more stable, more durable economic growth. But as any middle-class family will tell you, we\u2019re not yet where we need to be. Because even before the crisis hit, we had lived through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by.\n\nAnd reversing this trend should be -- must be -- Washington\u2019s highest priority. It\u2019s my highest priority. (Applause.) I want to make sure that in America, it doesn\u2019t matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love -- you should be able to make it when you try. You should be able to make it. (Applause.)\n\nNow, unfortunately, for the last year or so, we\u2019ve had an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals that shift focus away from what do we need to do to shore up middle-class families and create ladders of opportunity for folks to get into the middle class. And as Washington heads towards another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m traveling around, laying out my ideas for how we have to build the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class: a good job with good wages; a home to call your own; a good education; affordable health care that\u2019s there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you\u2019re not rich; the opportunity -- the ladders of opportunity for people to earn their way into the middle class, to work their way out of poverty. Those are the elements that I think all of us believe in, but right now we're not delivering as much as we should on those promises.\n\nNow, last Tuesday, I went to Tennessee to talk about the first cornerstone, which is how do we make sure that we're creating good middle-class jobs here in the United States of America. Today I've come to Phoenix to talk about the second component, which is the most tangible cornerstone that lies at the heart of the American Dream, at the heart of middle-class life -- and that's the chance to own your own home. (Applause.) The chance to own your own home.\n\nWe've got a lot of young people here who are thinking about college, they're going to get a higher education, they're going to find a job, they're going to find somebody they love, they're going to want to own a home. And the reason they will is because a home is the ultimate evidence that here in America, hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded.\n\nI think about my grandparents\u2019 generation. When my grandfather served in World War II, he fought in Patton's Army -- when he got back, this country gave him a chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill, but it also gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. To him, and to generations of Americans before and since, a home was more than just a house. It was a source of pride and a source of security. It was a place to raise kids, to put down roots; a place where you could build up savings for college, or to start a business, or to retire with some security.\n\nAnd buying a home required responsibility on everybody\u2019s part. You had to save up to buy a home. And then banks were supposed to give you a fair deal, with terms you could understand, and buyers were supposed to live within their means and make sure that they could make their payments. So in that earlier generation, houses weren\u2019t for flipping around, they weren\u2019t for speculation -- houses were to live in, and to build a life with.\n\nAnd unfortunately, over time, responsibility too often gave way to recklessness. You had reckless lenders who sold loans to people they knew couldn\u2019t afford them. And let's face it, we also had some reckless buyers who knew they couldn\u2019t afford them and still took out loans. And all this created a housing bubble. And especially in some places like Arizona, it was devastating when that bubble finally burst -- triggered a recession. Millions of Americans who had done everything right were hurt badly by the actions of other people. Housing prices plummeted.\n\nBy the time I took office, home values had fallen almost 20 percent from the year before. New housing starts had fallen nearly 80 percent from their peak. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers had lost their jobs. A record number of people were behind on their mortgage payments. And a lot of people here in Phoenix, they saw that devastation. This was part of Ground Zero for the housing bubble bursting.\n\nSo less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona and I laid out steps to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet. And the truth is it's been a long, slow process. The housing market is so big that it was going to take some time to heal when it got hurt that badly. It's taken longer than any of us would like. But during that time, we helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates. We helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which was good for their neighbors because you don't want a bunch of foreclosure signs in your neighborhood.\n\nWhere Congress wouldn\u2019t act, we went ahead and acted, so over the past few years, we had the Department of Justice stand up for buyers who had been discriminated against or conned by predatory lending. And we won a settlement that gave more money to victims of discrimination in one year than in the previous 23 years combined. (Applause.)\n\nWe worked with states to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million families -- largest lending settlement in history. (Applause.) We extended the time that folks who had lost their jobs could delay their payment on their mortgages while they kept looking for work. We cracked down on the bad practices that led to the crisis in the first place. I mean, you had some loans back there in the bubble that were called \u201cliar\u2019s loan.\u201d Now, something that's called a liar's loan is probably a bad idea. (Laughter.)\n\nSo because of all these actions we've been taking, our housing market is beginning to heal. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in seven years. Sales are up nearly 50 percent. Construction is up nearly 75 percent. New foreclosures are down by nearly two-thirds. Millions of families have been able to come up for air -- they\u2019re no longer underwater on their mortgages. (Applause.)\n\nAnd just like the crisis hit Phoenix very hard, thanks to some great leadership here locally, Phoenix has also led one of the biggest comebacks in the country. (Applause.) So you should be proud of what you've done here. Home prices in Phoenix have risen by nearly 20 percent over the last year. New home sales are up by more than 25 percent.\n\nThis morning, right before I came here, I visited Erickson Construction -- (applause.) We've got some Erickson folks here. And they were explaining how right when the bubble hit, Erickson shrank to less than a hundred workers. Today they're employing 580 people -- and they\u2019re hiring even more people -- (applause) -- because the housing market is bouncing back.\n\nSo that's one of the things about housing. It's not just important for the person who owns the house; our economy is so impacted by everything that happens in housing. Consumers feel better when their home values are in a better place, so they're more willing to spend. A lot of people who want to start a business, their savings may be locked up in their house. Construction workers, contractors, suppliers, carpet makers, all these folks are impacted by the housing industry.\n\nSo we've made progress, and that's helped to move the economy forward. But we've got to build on this progress. We're not where we need to be yet. We've got to give more hardworking Americans the chance to buy their first home. (Applause.) We have to help more responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, because a lot of them still have a spread between the rates they're paying right now on their mortgage and what they could be getting if they were able to refinance.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve got to turn the page on this kind of bubble-and-bust mentality that helped to create this mess in the first place. (Applause.) We got to build a housing system that is durable and fair and rewards responsibility for generations to come. That's what we\u2019ve got to do. (Applause.)\n\nSo I\u2019ve already put forward a bunch of ideas that will help accomplish that. And, look, the fact of the matter is Congress hasn\u2019t enacted all of them, so I\u2019d like you to encourage members of Congress to take some of these actions. (Applause.)\n\nBut like the other actions that we\u2019ve taken, these will not help the neighbors down the street who bought a house that they couldn\u2019t afford, and then walked away from it and left a foreclosed home behind. We don't want to help speculators who bought multiple homes just to make a quick buck.\n\nWhat we want to do is put forward ideas that will help millions of responsible, middle-class homeowners who still need relief. And we want to help hardworking Americans who dream of owning their own home fair and square, have a down payment, are willing to make those payments, understand that owning a home requires responsibility. And there are some immediate actions we could take right now that would help on that front, that would make a difference. So let me just list a couple of them.\n\nNumber one: Congress should pass a good, bipartisan idea to allow every homeowner the chance to save thousands of dollars a year by refinancing their mortgage at today\u2019s rates. (Applause.) We need to get that done. We\u2019ve been talking about it for a year and a half, two years, three years. There\u2019s no reason not to do it. (Applause.)\n\nStep number two: Now that we\u2019ve made it harder for reckless buyers to buy homes that they can\u2019t afford, let\u2019s make it a little bit easier for qualified buyers to buy the homes that they can afford. (Applause.) So Shaun Donovan has been working with the finance industry to make sure we\u2019re simplifying overlapping regulations; we\u2019re cutting red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but keep getting rejected by the banks. We need to give well-qualified Americans who lost their jobs during the crisis a fair chance to get a loan if they\u2019ve worked hard to repair their credit.\n\nAnd step three is something that you don\u2019t always hear about when it comes to the housing market, and that is fixing our broken immigration system. It would actually help our housing market. (Applause.)\n\nIt\u2019s pretty simple: When more people buy homes and play by the rules, home values go up for everybody. And according to one recent study, the average homeowner has already seen the value of their home boosted by thousands of dollars just because of immigration. And the good news is, with the help of your Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, the Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration bill. It\u2019s got the support of CEOs and labor and law enforcement. (Applause.) This could help homeownership here.\n\nSo I want you to encourage Republicans in the House of Representatives to stop dragging their feet. Let\u2019s go ahead and get this done.\n\nStep number four: We should address the uneven recovery by rebuilding the communities hit the hardest by the housing crisis, including many right here in Arizona. Let\u2019s put construction back -- construction workers back to work repairing rundown homes, tearing down vacant properties so that the value of homes in those surrounding areas start picking up. We can put people to work right now and improve the remaining housing stock that's out there. (Applause.) Places that are facing a longer road back from the crisis should have their country\u2019s help to get back on their feet.\n\nStep five: We should make sure families that don\u2019t want to buy a home or can\u2019t yet afford to buy one still have a decent place to rent. (Applause.) It\u2019s important for us to encourage homeownership, but a lot of people rent and there\u2019s nothing wrong with renting. And we got to make sure that we are creating affordable opportunities when it comes to rental properties.\n\nIn the run-up to the crisis, banks and governments too often made everybody feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren\u2019t ready and didn't have the payments. That\u2019s a mistake we should not repeat. Instead, let\u2019s invest in affordable rental housing. Let\u2019s bring together cities and states to address local barriers that drive up rents for working families. (Applause.)\n\nSo if we help more Americans refinance their homes, if we help qualified families get a mortgage, we reform our immigration system, we rebuild the hardest-hit communities, we make sure that folks have a decent place to rent if they're not yet able to buy -- all these steps will give more middle-class families the chance to either buy their own home now or eventually buy their own home. It's going to give more relief to responsible homeowners. It gives more options to families who aren\u2019t yet ready to buy. All that is going to improve the housing market and will improve the economy.\n\nBut -- and this is the last key point I want to make -- as home prices rise, we can\u2019t just re-inflate another housing bubble. I hope everybody here in Arizona learned some hard lessons from what happened. Housing prices generally don't just keep on going up forever at the kind of pace it was going up. It was crazy. So what we want to do is something stable and steady. And that's why I want to lay a rock-solid foundation to make sure the kind of crisis we went through never happens again. We've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. (Applause.)\n\nAnd one of the key things to make sure it doesn't happen again is to wind down these companies that are not really government, but not really private sector -- they're known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For too long, these companies were allowed to make huge profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag. It was \u201cheads we win, tails you lose.\u201d And it was wrong. And along with what happened on Wall Street, it helped to inflate this bubble in a way that ultimately killed Main Street.\n\nSo the good news is, right now there\u2019s a bipartisan group of senators working to end Fannie and Freddie as we know them. And I support these kinds of reform efforts. And they're following four core principles for what I believe this reform should look like.\n\nFirst, private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist -- I think I saw some posters there on the way in. (Laughter.) But I actually believe in the free market. And just like the health care law that we put in place, Obamacare -- (applause) -- which, by the way, if you don't have health insurance or you're buying it at exorbitant rates on the individual market, starting on October 1st, you can join a marketplace and be part of a pool that gives you much lower premiums, saves you a lot of money. (Applause.)\n\nBut in the same way that what we did with health care was to set up clear rules for insurance companies to protect consumers, make it more affordable, but still built on the private marketplace, I believe that our housing system should operate where there's a limited government role and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not as a number, but as a neighbor. So that's one principle.\n\nA second principle is we can't leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. (Applause.) We've got to encourage the pursuit of profit, but the era of expecting a bailout after you pursue your profit and you don't manage your risk well -- well, that puts the whole country at risk. And we're ending those days. We're not going to do that anymore. (Applause.)\n\nThe third principle is we should preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. That\u2019s something families should be able to rely on when they're making the most important purchase of their lives. (Applause.)\n\nNumber four, we've got to keep housing affordable for first-time homebuyers -- like all these young people. When they're ready to buy a house, we've got to make sure it's affordable. Families who are working to climb their way into the middle class, we've got to do what we can to make housing affordable. And that means we've got to strengthen the FHA so it gives today\u2019s families the same kind of chance it gave my grandparents to buy a home, and it preserves those rungs on the ladder of opportunity.\n\nAnd we've got to support, as I said, affordable rental housing. And, by the way, we've also got to keep up our fight against homelessness. (Applause.) The Mayor of Phoenix has been doing a great job here in Phoenix on that front. We've got to continue to improve it. (Applause.)\n\nSince I took office, we helped bring one in four homeless veterans off the streets. (Applause.) We should be proud of that. Here in Phoenix, thanks to the hard work of everyone from Mayor Stanton to the local United Way to US Airways, you\u2019re on track to end chronic homelessness for veterans, period, by 2014. (Applause.)\n\nBut we've got to keep going, because nobody in America, and certainly no veteran, should be left to live on the streets. (Applause.)\n\nSo here's the bottom line: Put all these principles together, that's going to protect our entire economy and it will improve the housing market not just here in Phoenix, but throughout the state and throughout the country.\n\nWe're also going to need to make sure, though, that we're protecting individual homeowners. We've got to give them the tools that they can protect themselves. So we've got a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that we created. (Applause.) And it's laying down new rules of the road that everybody can count on when they\u2019re shopping for a mortgage. They\u2019re designing a new, simple mortgage form that will be in plain English, so you can actually read it without a lawyer -- (applause) -- although, you may still want a lawyer obviously. I'm not saying you don't. I'm just saying you'll be able to read it. (Laughter.) There won't be a lot of fine print. That way you know before you owe. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nAnd the Senate finally confirmed Richard Cordray as the head of this -- head watchdog for the CFPB. (Applause.) So he's out there aggressively protecting consumers and homeowners.\n\nWhen it comes to some of the other leaders we need to look out for the American people, the Senate still has a job to do. Months ago, I nominated a man named Mel Watt to be our nation\u2019s top housing regulator. He is an outstanding member of Congress. And during that time, he was on the Housing Committee -- worked with banks, worked with borrowers to protect consumers, to help responsible lenders provide credit. He is the right person for the job. Congress and the Senate should give his nomination an up or down vote without any more obstruction or delay. We don't have time for those kinds of games. (Applause.)\n\nSo I want to be honest with you. No program or policy is going to solve all the problems in a multi-trillion dollar housing market. The housing bubble went up so high, the heights it reached before it burst were so unsustainable, that we knew it was going to take some time for us to fully recover. But if we take the steps that I talked about today, then I know we will restore not just our home values, but also our common values. We\u2019ll make owning a home a symbol of responsibility, not speculation -- a source of security for generations to come, just like it was for my grandparents. I want it to be just like that for all the young people who are here today and their children and their grandchildren. (Applause.)\n\nAnd if we stay focused on middle-class security and opportunities to get into the middle class, if we take the strategy that I'm laying out for the entire economy -- for jobs and housing and education, health care, retirement, creating ladders of opportunity -- then we will secure that better bargain for all Americans, where hard work is once again rewarded with a shot at a middle-class life, which means more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will know the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \u201cOpen\u201d on their own business. More Americans will know the joy of scratching the child\u2019s height on the door of their new home -- with pencil, of course. (Laughter.)\n\nWe can do all this if we work together. And it won\u2019t be easy. But if we take just a few bold steps -- and if Washington will just end the gridlock, set aside the slash-and-burn partisanship -- (applause) -- actually try to solve problems instead of scoring political points, our economy will grow stronger a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now. (Applause.)\n\nAnd as long as I've got the privilege to serve as your President, that's what I'm going to be fighting for.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.)\n\nEND 1:35 P.M. MST"

    "text": "Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: \"Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. \"First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. \"I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. \"There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. \"This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. \"Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. \"Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. \"This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. \"Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. \"I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. \"Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired.\" ####"

    "text": "I recently completed a very short interview on Vatican Radio to discuss the current battle between the Obama administration and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. It didn\u2019t permit me to say more than that the Obama administration is making a political mistake, so I\u2019d like to say a bit more about the serious consequences that will likely result and how we ended up with this Church-State conundrum in the first place.\n\nAs Dr. Donald Condit has already explained, the Obama administration seems to be making a political calculation that this controversy will blow over before the November\u2019s presidential election, because the conscience exemption for providing and paying for abortion, sterilization, and contraception will not take effect until later next year. But the miscalculation was predictable and is now evident, with not only Catholics, but Orthodox, evangelical, Jewish and other religious leaders taking a stand. Unless the administration relents or the Obamacare law is ruled unconstitutional, Catholic hospitals and other institutions will be faced with a choice between not providing insurance coverage to their employees \u2013 and thereby being fined by the government \u2013 or pay for the provision of services that they believe are morally evil.\n\nA journalist friend in Rome just raised an alternative reading of the story to me on the street. What if Obama is actually making a principled argument that abortion, sterilization, and contraception services are a fundamental aspect of women\u2019s health that cannot and should not be denied to anyone, regardless of their own religious or individual convictions? Perhaps the White House believes, as most progressives do, that these stodgy, uptight opponents will eventually, inevitably, be overcome, and we will one day wonder what all the fuss about. If so, the administration is doing much more than thinking about the next election; it\u2019s redefining what the word \u201chealth\u201d means to include measures that violently take away life from the most innocent and vulnerable persons, regardless of who pays for the services. This makes it much more than a religious freedom or a conscience issue and a matter of simple justice.\n\nMore generally, the whole Obamacare mess is a result of employer-provided health insurance. We would all be better off if our health insurance was decoupled from our employment, and we were free to purchase our own insurance according to our needs and wants. It is a result of state intervention in the economy, namely wage-and-price controls, that led to employers offering health insurance as a non-wage benefit to entice desired employees to their companies. Now we have the government mandating that all employers must provide comprehensive coverage to all their employees. What was once a prudential individual decision has become a government-mandated \u201cright\u201d that trumps the employer-employee, the doctor-patient, and perhaps even the priest-penitent relationship. Some progress.\n\nThere is some tragic irony to all this. We should not forget that many religious leaders have long-supported increasing the role of the state in health care and the economy at-large, perhaps thinking that conscience clauses would protect their institutions against any undue interference. Well, they were wrong; what the state giveth, the state taketh away. If you invite the state to \u201cassist\u201d more and more of your activities, it will eventually start telling you how to do things. Encouraging the Democratic Party\u2019s efforts from Harry Truman on to socialize the healthcare system of the United States is likely to have dire consequences for Catholic and other religious-based social service providers. Economic ignorance among religious leaders comes at a very high cost to their own good works."

Hires were little changed at 5.8 million while total separations increased to 5.1 million. Within separations, the quits rate was unchanged at 2.2 percent while the layoffs and discharges rate increased to 1.2 percent. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job openings, hires, and separations for the total nonfarm sector, by industry, and by four geographic regions. Job Openings On the last business day of October, the number and rate of job openings were little changed at 6.7 million and 4.5 percent, respectively. Job openings increased in health care and social assistance (+122,000) and state and local government education (+23,000). The number of job openings was little changed in all four regions. (See table 1.) The number of job openings in October (not seasonally adjusted) decreased over the year to 7.1 million (-596,000) reflecting the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor market. Job openings decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in retail trade, accommodation and food services, and finance and insurance. Only nondurable goods manufacturing and durable goods manufacturing had increases in job openings. The number of job openings decreased in the Midwest region. (See table 7.) ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ | Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Impact on October 2020 JOLTS Data | | | |Data collection for the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey was affected by the coronavirus | |(COVID-19) pandemic. More information is available at the end of this news release and at | |www.bls.gov/covid19/job-openings-and-labor-turnover-covid19-october-2020.htm. | |_________________________________________________________________________________________________________| Hires In October, the number and rate of hires were little changed at 5.8 million and 4.1 percent, respectively. Hires decreased in wholesale trade (-81,000), other services (-74,000), and federal government (-12,000). The number of hires was little changed in all four regions. (See table 2.) The number of hires in October (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed over the year. Hires increased in a number of industries over the year, with the largest increases in transportation, warehousing, and utilities and in durable goods manufacturing. Hires decreased in construction and state and local government education. The number of hires was little changed in all four regions. (See table 8.) Separations Total separations includes quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Total separations is referred to as turnover. Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee. Therefore, the quits rate can serve as a measure of workers\u2019 willingness or ability to leave jobs. Layoffs and discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations includes separations due to retirement, death, disability, and transfers to other locations of the same firm. In October, the number of total separations increased to 5.1 million (+263,000). The total separations rate was little changed at 3.6 percent. The total separations level increased in federal government (+109,000), largely the result of separations of temporary 2020 Census workers. Total separations increased in the Northeast region. (See table 3.) Over the year, the number of total separations (not seasonally adjusted) decreased to 5.3 million (-408,000). Total separations decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in accommodation and food services and construction. Total separations increased in federal government and nondurable goods manufacturing. The number of total separations decreased in the West region. (See table 9.) In October, the number of quits was little changed at 3.1 million and the quits rate was unchanged at 2.2 percent. Quits increased in arts, entertainment, and recreation (+17,000) and federal government (+7,000). The number of quits was little changed in all four regions. (See table 4.) Over the year, the number of quits (not seasonally adjusted) decreased to 3.3 million (-261,000). Quits declined in several industries, with the largest decreases in accommodation and food services and other services. The quits level increased in a number of industries with the largest increases in retail trade and wholesale trade. Over the year, the number of quits decreased in the Midwest and West regions. (See table 10.) The number and rate of layoffs and discharges increased to 1.7 million (+243,000) and 1.2 percent, respectively in October. The number of layoffs and discharges increased in federal government (+91,000), largely due to the release of temporary 2020 Census workers. Layoffs and discharges increased in the Northeast region. (See table 5.) Over the year, the layoffs and discharges level (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed. Layoffs and discharges decreased in arts, entertainment, and recreation and in wholesale trade. The number of layoffs and discharges increased in federal government. The number of layoffs and discharges decreased over the year in the West region. (See table 11.) The number of other separations was little changed in October at 336,000. Other separations increased in federal government (+10,000). Other separations were little changed in all four regions. (See table 6.) Over the year, the other separations level (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed at 321,000. Other separations decreased in a number of industries with the largest decrease in information. Other separations increased in federal government. The number of other separations was little changed in all four regions. (See table 12.) Net Change in Employment Large numbers of hires and separations occur every month throughout the business cycle. Net employment change results from the relationship between hires and separations. When the number of hires exceeds the number of separations, employment rises, even if the hires level is steady or declining. Conversely, when the number of hires is less than the number of separations, employment declines, even if the hires level is steady or rising. Over the 12 months ending in October, hires totaled 70.4 million and separations totaled 76.1 million, yielding a net employment loss of 5.7 million. These totals include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year. ____________ The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey estimates for November 2020 are scheduled to be released on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. (ET). __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ | Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Impact on October 2020 | | Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey Data | | | |Data collection for the JOLTS survey was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the procedures described in this technical note have been modified. The modifications are briefly described in the box note in the news release and are described in more detail at www.bls.gov/covid19/effects-of-covid-19-pandemic-on-job-openings-and-labor-turnover-data.htm. This news release presents statistics from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS program provides information on labor demand and turnover. Additional information about the JOLTS program can be found at www.bls.gov/jlt/. Estimates are published for job openings, hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations. The JOLTS program covers all private nonfarm establishments, as well as federal, state, and local government entities in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Industries are classified in accordance with the North American Industry Classification System. Definitions Employment. Employment includes persons on the payroll who worked or received pay for the pay period that includes the 12th day of the reference month. Full-time, part-time, permanent, short-term, seasonal, salaried, and hourly employees are included, as are employees on paid vacation or other paid leave. Proprietors or partners of unincorporated businesses, unpaid family workers, or employees on strike for the entire pay period, and employees on leave without pay for the entire pay period are not counted as employed. Employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, and consultants are counted by their employer of record, not by the establishment where they are working. Job Openings. Job openings include all positions that are open on the last business day of the reference month. A job is open only if it meets all three of these conditions: * A specific position exists and there is work available for that position. The position can be full-time or part- time, and it can be permanent, short-term, or seasonal. * The job could start within 30 days, whether or not the employer can find a suitable candidate during that time. * The employer is actively recruiting workers from outside the establishment to fill the position. Active recruiting means that the establishment is taking steps to fill a position. It may include advertising in newspapers, on television, or on the radio; posting Internet notices, posting \u201chelp wanted\u201d signs, networking or making \u201cword-of-mouth\u201d announcements; accepting applications; interviewing candidates; contacting employment agencies; or soliciting employees at job fairs, state or local employment offices, or similar sources. Excluded are positions open only to internal transfers, promotions or demotions, or recall from layoffs. Also excluded are openings for positions with start dates more than 30 days in the future, positions for which employees have been hired but the employees have not yet reported for work, and positions to be filled by employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The job openings rate is computed by dividing the number of job openings by the sum of employment and job openings and multiplying that quotient by 100. Hires. Hires include all additions to the payroll during the entire reference month, including newly hired and rehired employees; full-time and part-time employees; permanent, short-term, and seasonal employees; employees who were recalled to a job at the location following a layoff (formal suspension from pay status) lasting more than 7 days; on-call or intermittent employees who returned to work after having been formally separated; workers who were hired and separated during the month, and transfers from other locations. Excluded are transfers or promotions within the reporting location, employees returning from strike, employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The hires rate is computed by dividing the number of hires by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. Separations. Separations include all separations from the payroll during the entire reference month and is reported by type of separation: quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Quits include employees who left voluntarily with the exception of retirements or transfers to other locations. Layoffs and discharges includes involuntary separations initiated by the employer including layoffs with no intent to rehire; layoffs (formal suspensions from pay status) lasting or expected to last more than 7 days; discharges resulting from mergers, downsizing, or closings; firings or other discharges for cause; terminations of permanent or short-term employees; and terminations of seasonal employees (whether or not they are expected to return the next season). Other separations include retirements, transfers to other locations, separations due to employee disability; and deaths. Excluded from separations are transfers within the same location; employees on strike; employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The separations rate is computed by dividing the number of separations by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. The quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations rates are computed similarly. Estimation Method The JOLTS survey design is a stratified random sample of 20,700 nonfarm business and government establishments. The sample is stratified by ownership, region, industry sector, and establishment size class. The establishments are drawn from a universe of over 9.4 million establishments compiled by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program which includes all employers subject to state unemployment insurance laws and federal agencies subject to the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program. Employment estimates are benchmarked, or ratio adjusted, monthly to the strike-adjusted employment estimates of the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey. A ratio of CES to JOLTS employment is used to adjust the levels for all other JOLTS data elements. Birth/death model. The time lag from the start up, or birth, of an establishment until its appearance on the sampling frame is approximately one year. Also within the first year, new businesses may go out of business, referred to as a death. Because not all births and deaths of establishments can be reflected on the sampling frame immediately, the JOLTS sample cannot capture job openings, hires, and separations from them during their early existence. BLS has developed a birth/death model that uses establishment birth and death activity from previous years. The estimates of job openings, hires, and separations produced by the birth/death model are added to the sample-based estimates produced from the survey to arrive at the estimates for job openings, hires, and separations. Alignment. The JOLTS figure for hires minus separations can be used to derive a measure of net employment change. This change should be comparable to the net employment change from the much larger CES survey. However, definitional differences as well as sampling and non- sampling errors between the two surveys historically caused JOLTS to diverge from CES over time. To limit the divergence, and improve the quality of the JOLTS hires and separations series, BLS implemented the monthly alignment method. There are four steps to this method: seasonally adjust, align, back out the seasonal adjustment factors, and re-seasonally adjust. Seasonal adjustment. BLS uses X-13 ARIMA for seasonal adjustment. A concurrent seasonal adjustment methodology is used in which new seasonal adjustment factors are calculated each month, using all relevant data, up to and including current month data. JOLTS seasonal adjustment includes both additive and multiplicative models and REGARIMA (regression with auto-correlated errors) modeling to improve the seasonal adjustment factors at the beginning and end of the series and to detect and adjust for outliers in the series. The seasonally adjusted CES employment trends are applied to the seasonally adjusted JOLTS implied employment trends (hires minus separations) forcing them to be approximately the same, while preserving the seasonality of the JOLTS data. Annual estimates. The JOLTS estimates are revised annually to reflect annual updates to the CES employment estimates and the JOLTS seasonal adjustment factors. The JOLTS employment levels (not published) are ratio- adjusted to the CES employment levels, and the resulting ratios are applied to all JOLTS data elements. The seasonally adjusted data are recalculated for the most recent 5 years in order to reflect updated seasonal adjustment factors. These annual updates result in revisions to both the seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted JOLTS data series, for the period since the last benchmark was established. Annual levels for hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations are the sum of the 12 published monthly levels. Annual rates are computed by dividing the annual level by the Current Employment Statistics (CES) annual average employment level, and multiplying that quotient by 100. This figure will be approximately equal to the sum of the 12 monthly rates. Consistent with BLS practice, annual estimates are published only for not seasonally adjusted data and are released with the January news release each year. Annual estimates are not calculated for job openings because job openings are a stock, or point-in-time, measurement for the last business day of each month. Reliability of the estimates JOLTS estimates are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. Nonsampling error occurs when a sample is surveyed rather than the entire population. There is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The difference, or sampling error, varies depending on the particular sample selected. This variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. BLS analysis is generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. That means that there is a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because of sampling error. Sampling error estimates are available at www.bls.gov/jlt/jolts_median_standard_errors.htm. The JOLTS estimates also are affected by nonsampling error.

    "text": "Number two is that, although there are some programs in there that I think are good policy, some of them aren't job creators. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that those programs should be out of this particular recovery package, and we can deal with them later.\n\nBut when they start characterizing this as pork without acknowledging that there are no earmarks in this package -- something, again, that was pretty rare over the last eight years -- then you get a feeling that maybe we're playing politics instead of actually trying to solve problems for the American people.\n\nSo I'm going to keep on engaging. I hope that as we get the Senate and the House bills together, that everybody is willing to give a little bit. I suspect that the package that emerges is not going to be a hundred percent of what I want. But my bottom line is, are we creating 4 million jobs, and are we laying the foundation for long- term economic growth?\n\nThis is another concern that I've had in some of the arguments that I'm hearing. When people suggest that what a waste of money to make federal buildings more energy-efficient -- why would that be a waste of money? We're creating jobs immediately by retrofitting these buildings or weatherizing 2 million Americans' homes, as was called for in the package. So that right there creates economic stimulus, and we are saving taxpayers, when it comes to federal buildings, potentially $2 billion. In the case of homeowners, they will see more money in their pockets. And we're reducing our dependence on foreign oil in the Middle East. Why wouldn't we want to make that kind of investment?\n\nNow, maybe philosophically you just don't think that the federal government should be involved in energy policy. I happen to disagree with that. I think that's the reason why we find ourselves importing more foreign oil right now than we did back in the early '70s, when OPEC first formed. And we can have a respectful debate about whether or not we should be involved in energy policymaking, but don't suggest that somehow that's wasteful spending. That's exactly what this country needs.\n\nThe same applies when it comes to information technologies and health care. We know that health care is crippling businesses and making us less competitive, as well as breaking the banks of families all across America. And part of the reason is we've got the most inefficient health care system imaginable. We're still using paper. We're -- we're still filing things in triplicate. Nurses can't read the prescriptions that doctors -- that doctors have written out. Why wouldn't we want to put that on an -- put that on an electronic medical record that will reduce error rates, reduce our long-term cost of health care, and create jobs right now?\n\nEducation, yet another example. The suggestion is, why should the federal government be involved in school construction? Well, I visited a school down in South Carolina that was built in the 1850s. Kids are still learning in that school -- as best they can. When the -- when the railroad -- when the -- it's right next to a railroad, and when the train runs by the whole building shakes and the teacher has to stop teaching for a while. The -- the auditorium is completely broken down and they can't use it. So why wouldn't we want to build state-of-the-art schools with science labs that are teaching our kids the skills they need for the 21st century, that will enhance our economy and, by the way, right now will create jobs?"

So now what's his plan to clean up the GOP's image and keep control of the House this November? For answers, we turn to Congressman Boehner.\n\nAnd congratulations. Welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".\n\nHOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JOHN BOEHNER, R-OHIO: Chris, it's good to be here.\n\nWALLACE: Especially in this position, huh?\n\nBOEHNER: It's been a long way back, but I'm certainly glad the race went well. But we have a lot of work ahead of us.\n\nWALLACE: Well, let's talk about that. After you won this week, you said Republicans are looking at their own re-election and the environment right now is not real good.\n\nHow much trouble are Republicans in, in terms of maintaining their control of the House in November?\n\n(Story continues below)\n\nADVERTISEMENTS Advertise Here\n\nBOEHNER: I think that we've got challenges ahead of us. The president's numbers have been down. But the economy is good. And I think the effort in Iraq continues to go well.\n\nBut what we need to do is to address the anxieties that the American people are feeling about the economy, their own personal security, their jobs. And if we're able to address those anxieties that they're feeling, I think we'll do well in November.\n\nWALLACE: Did you win because House Republicans wanted to signal a clear break with the era of Tom DeLay ?\n\nBOEHNER: I think I won because I was presenting to my colleagues that we needed to really work on a common vision of who are we, why are we here, and what is it that we hope to accomplish on behalf of the American people, and that out of that vision we can develop an agenda.\n\nSo I think it was more about management and leadership than it was about any other issue.\n\nWALLACE: Job one, clearly, at least in terms of the public perception, is lobbying reform. Speaker Hastert just came out with a package that would ban almost all gifts and privately funded travel, but you said on Friday there is no package. So is the Hastert plan inoperative?\n\nBOEHNER: There is a package. Speaker Hastert and the chairman of the Rules Committee, David Dreier , have been working on a package. Democrat leadership's been working on a package. And what's going on right now is that Mr. Dreier, who's been heading up this effort, is working on a bipartisan basis to try to bring this package together.\n\nI think it's important that the members be very involved in the development of this package, and so you're going to see conversations going on within our caucus, within the Democrat caucus, and efforts between the two to develop this bipartisan package over the coming weeks.\n\nWALLACE: But you have indicated \u2014 in fact, at one point, you used and then took back the word \"childish\" to describe this idea of all these bans on gifts and travel. Do you feel, in fact, that bans make less sense than just more disclosure of what happens?\n\nBOEHNER: I think that some of the proposals that were out there \u2014 and there have been a lot of proposals offered by members, by outside groups. And I thought some of the proposals were outright childish, treating members like kids.\n\nI think that what we need to do is we need to deal with the underlying problems that we have today. And I believe that disclosure of the relationship between those who lobby us, whether they be paid lobbyists here in Washington, those from agencies, or others \u2014 disclosure of those relationships \u2014 and let the American people take a look at how this relationship works.\n\nSunlight's the best disinfectant. I think it will help.\n\nWALLACE: So you're OK with some of these privately funded trips?\n\nBOEHNER: I think on the privately funded trips, if there is approval by the Ethics Committee that it's an appropriate trip, that it meets the rules of the House, then we ought to allow members to do it.\n\nWe can't lock members up in a cubbyhole here in Washington and never let them see what's going on around the country and around the world. Members need to be educated. They need to be kept up to speed on what's happening. And these trips to a large extent help educate members.\n\nWALLACE: But let me ask you about that, Congressman. You are known, fairly or not, as a frequent flyer on a lot of these privately funded trips. If lobbyists want to make their case, why do they have to take you, as they have, to Europe or to Pebble Beach Golf Course?\n\nI mean, aren't they, in effect, buying a kind of access to you or other legislators that the average citizen back home can't hope to get?\n\nBOEHNER: It's not about lobbyists on many of these trips in terms of making their case. It's about going to an industry meeting. It's going to look at a nuclear energy system in Spain, as an example, to gain an appreciation of what's happening in that industry, or \u2014 the Aspen Institute , going to an education seminar.\n\nThese are worthy activities that help educate members, but they ought to be approved before members go.\n\nWALLACE: During your campaign for leader, you proposed a ban on earmarks , these provisions, pork provisions, that are snuck into bills by legislators. But I want to show you something that Speaker Hastert said recently about bans \u2014 about earmarks, rather. Take a look. \"Who knows best where to put a bridge or a highway or a red light in their district?\"\n\nQuestion, who speaks for Republicans, you or Speaker Hastert?\n\nBOEHNER: Denny Hastert and I have been friends for 15 years. We've worked together. We're good friends. And we are working together. He's the boss. He is the speaker of the House.\n\nI've never called for an outright ban on earmarks. I've never asked for one in the 15 years that I've been in Congress. I told my constituents in 1990 that if they thought my job was to go to Washington and rob the federal treasury on their behalf, they're voting for the wrong guy. And so I've never asked for one.\n\nBut I don't think I want to hold all my colleagues to that same standard. There's an appropriate place for some of these earmarks, but we need less numbers of earmarks and more transparency and more accountability. Members' names ought to be associated with them. They ought to be visible. And members ought to have a chance to see these before they become law.\n\nWALLACE: If I were a Democrat listening to what you've been saying today \u2014 you're talking about well, we're not going to ban earmarks, we're not going to ban private travel \u2014 I think I could probably make a campaign ad saying business as usual.\n\nBOEHNER: Well, listen, in the past, when these scandals have erupted, what's happened is Congress has overreacted, and two days later nobody knew what happened. And what I want to do is to work with the members to address where the problems are.\n\nUnderstand that all the activities associated with Jack Abramoff , Duke Cunningham , former member who resigned in disgrace, and other members who have problems \u2014 they've already violated the law and/or they violated the rules of the House.\n\nBringing more transparency to this relationship I think is the best way to control it. But taking...\n\nWALLACE: Not bans.\n\nBOEHNER: ... taking actions to ban this and ban that, when there's no appearance of a problem, there's no foundation of a problem, I think, in fact, does not serve the institution well.\n\nWALLACE: You are known as a Republican who can work with Democrats. Do you want to see an end to the hyper-partisanship of the DeLay era, when Democrats were often just shut out of legislating?\n\nBOEHNER: I've worked with Democrats on many occasions. I've stood up to them and gone toe to toe with them. But there are a lot of issues in the national interest that Democrats and Republicans can work together on. And I believe that \u2014 look at George Miller , my colleague from California. He's as liberal as I am conservative.\n\nWALLACE: He's the ranking Democrat on your committee, the Education Committee.\n\nBOEHNER: On my committee. And we've had our disagreements. We've had our fights, if you will. But there are a lot of other issues where we've worked closely together, and trying to improve education in America is a good example.\n\nNow, I do believe that we ought to have a more open process. The Democrats ought to be able to play. This is the United States of America. This is democracy. And all members should be allowed to have their say. And they can't win. You know, I'm not saying they're going to win everything, but they ought to be able to have their say.\n\nWALLACE: Let me ask you about an issue, Medicare prescription drug benefit. How do you think it's working? Does Congress need to fix it?\n\nBOEHNER: The implementation of the Medicare plan has been horrendous. We've made it far more complicated than it should be.\n\nThe good news is that the competition that's being created has lowered premiums significantly below where Congress thought they'd be when we put the bill together, so the competition side is good. I think the implementation side continues to need to be improved.\n\nWALLACE: You've been called more of a chamber of commerce Republican than a social conservative. Are you going to emphasize \u2014 in your job as leader, are you going to emphasize meat and potato issues?\n\nBOEHNER: Chris, I've got 11 brothers and sisters, and my dad owned a bar. I worked my way through school. I started my own business. And if it weren't for the free enterprise system in America, I wouldn't be here.\n\nI came here because I thought government was too big, that it spent too much and was too intrusive into our lives. And I do believe that we've got to gain control of this government. And so there's not an issue here between the fiscal side and the social side.\n\nYou grow up with 11 brothers and sisters, you learn an awful lot about social issues and being a family, and all of these issues are important. So I don't think we need to pick sides one way or the other.\n\nWALLACE: Finally, let's talk a little bit about John Boehner. I want to show you something that The New York Times wrote about you this week. Here, take a look. \"Easy-going and well-liked, with a perpetual tan, a low golf handicap and an ever-present Barclay cigarette between his fingers, Mr. Boehner looks like a throwback to the '50s \u2014 Dean Martin comes to Washington.\" Any problems with that?\n\nBOEHNER: Chris, I'm an ordinary guy with a big job. And while I take my work very serious, I don't take myself very serious. And I don't allow my staff to call me Congressman or Mr. Leader. They call me John, or most of them just refer to me as hey, Boehner.\n\nI'm just open. You know, what you see is what you get. I've got a very good relationship with the media, with my colleagues, frankly, the people downtown, and my constituents, because this is the way I am.\n\nWALLACE: I do have to ask you the one question that a lot of people asked me this week. How do you keep that tan?\n\nBOEHNER: I was born dark, but I do like to play a little golf, and it's my escape from all of the pressures of my job.\n\nWALLACE: Six handicap?\n\nBOEHNER: I do have a six handicap.\n\nWALLACE: Well, that's going to go up now with this new job.\n\nBOEHNER: I'm sure my colleagues are hoping so.\n\nWALLACE: Congressman Boehner, we want to thank you, especially for joining us on your very first weekend as leader. Please come back."

    "text": "The full text of the op-ed by President Barack Obama is printed below. The piece was published today in Newsweek.\n\nPresident Obama Reflects on the Impact of Title IX\n\nBy President Obama\n\nCoaching my daughter Sasha\u2019s basketball team is one of those times when I just get to be \u201cDad.\u201d I snag rebounds, run drills, and have a little fun. More importantly, I get to watch Sasha and her teammates improve together, start thinking like a team, and develop self-confidence.\n\nAny parent knows there are few things more fulfilling than watching your child discover a passion for something. And as a parent, you\u2019ll do anything to make sure he or she grows up believing she can take that ambition as far as she wants; that your child will embrace that quintessentially American idea that she can go as far as her talents will take her.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t so long ago that something like pursuing varsity sports was an unlikely dream for young women in America. Their teams often made do with second-rate facilities, hand-me-down uniforms, and next to no funding.\n\nWhat changed? Well, 40 years ago, committed women from around the country, driven by everyone who said they couldn\u2019t do something, worked with Congress to ban gender discrimination in our public schools. Title IX was the result of their efforts, and this week, we celebrated its 40th anniversary\u201440 years of ensuring equal education, in and out of the classroom, regardless of gender.\n\nI was reminded of this milestone last month, when I awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pat Summitt. When she started out as a basketball coach, Pat drove the team van to away games. She washed the uniforms in her own washing machine. One night she and her team even camped out in an opponent\u2019s gym because they had no funding for a hotel. But she and her players kept their chins up and their heads in the game. And in 38 years at the University of Tennessee, Pat won eight national championships and tallied more than 1,000 wins\u2014the most by any college coach, man or woman. More important, every single woman who ever played for Pat has either graduated or is on her way to a degree.\n\nToday, thanks in no small part to the confidence and determination they developed through competitive sports and the work ethic they learned with their teammates, girls who play sports are more likely to excel in school. In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men. This is a great accomplishment\u2014not just for one sport or one college or even just for women but for America. And this is what Title IX is all about.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget, Title IX isn\u2019t just about sports. From addressing inequality in math and science education to preventing sexual assault on campus to fairly funding athletic programs, Title IX ensures equality for our young people in every aspect of their education. It\u2019s a springboard for success: it\u2019s thanks in part to legislation like Title IX that more women graduate from college prepared to work in a much broader range of fields, including engineering and technology. I\u2019ve said that women will shape the destiny of this country, and I mean it. The more confident, empowered women who enter our boardrooms and courtrooms, legislatures, and hospitals, the stronger we become as a country.\n\nAnd that is what we are seeing today. Women are not just taking a seat at the table or sitting at the head of it, they are creating success on their own terms. The women who grew up with Title IX now pioneer scientific breakthroughs, run thriving businesses, govern states, and, yes, coach varsity teams. Because they do, today\u2019s young women grow up hearing fewer voices that tell them \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d and more voices that tell them \u201cYou can.\u201d\n\nWe have come so far. But there\u2019s so much farther we can go. There are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make. As president, I\u2019ll do my part to keep Title IX strong and vibrant, and maintain our schools as doorways of opportunity so every child has a fair shot at success. And as a dad, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make sure that this country remains the place where, no matter who you are or what you look like, you can make it if you try."

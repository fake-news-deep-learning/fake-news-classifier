    "text": "With polls showing that President Obama is losing ground, The Post asked political experts what he could do to regain the initiative. Below are contributions from Scott Keeter, Michael S. Berman, Newt Gingrich, Donna Brazile, Robert J. Blendon, Christine Todd Whitman, Dan Schnur, Ed Rogers, Harold Ford Jr. and Ed Gillespie.\n\nSCOTT KEETER\n\nDirector of survey research at Pew Research Center\n\nPresident Obama had a better honeymoon with the public than either Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. But it's over now. His ratings are approaching his electoral margin.\n\nThis summer slump is a product of his own actions and political forces outside his control. Obama campaigned for strong government action on the economy and health care, and most of his voters agreed with this direction. But Obama's efforts to expand the role of government have alienated many of those who did not vote for him but nonetheless gave him high marks when first he took office.\n\nPew Research's political values survey this spring showed no surge in public demand for more government. Indeed, anti-government sentiment, which had been building for years, was heightened by the financial bailout and stimulus program. Moreover, it was inevitable that Obama eventually would have to take responsibility for the economy, which -- despite a few green shoots -- remains grim.\n\nThe health-care debate has taken a toll on the president's popularity as well as that of his party. Americans remain ambivalent, desiring most of the major elements in the reform proposals but simultaneously worrying about too much government control of health care. Obama can influence whether and how reform passes, and whether it passes at all will affect his approval rating. Democrats in Congress fear that passing an unpopular health care package will be politically costly, but as Clinton's #### experience demonstrated, they have good reason to fear that failure on health care could also be costly.\n\nMICHAEL S. BERMAN\n\nPresident of the Duberstein Group; former counsel and deputy chief of staff to Vice President Walter Mondale\n\nFirst, the president should not over-read or over-rely on polls. To get some perspective, check out the Aug. ## piece by Jeremy Rosner of Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research entitled A Pollster's Advice: do not Trust the Polls on Health Reform's Demise.\n\nSecond, Obama should show that he understands that people are being asked to accept changes in the health-care system while they are in the throes of actual or potential crisis in their personal financial systems. And that he has heard the concerns raised by affected Americans nationwide. While the media attention to various town halls was in the best tradition of if it bleeds it leads, most of the people who came out did so out of a real need and interest to learn more about health-care reform proposals.\n\nThird, invite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid to a meeting, just the three of them, and work through with them a plan for going forward. Work with the congressional leadership to come up with a single bill that represents the doable, sans the wish list of every idea for changing health care that has been suggested in the past several decades. And get to that bill before the process kind of stumbles on to it.\n\nFinally, choose a dramatic forum, perhaps a joint session of Congress, to lay out a bill that includes core changes but reflects having heard what is bothering the people he was elected to lead.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH\n\nFormer Republican speaker of the House of Representatives\n\nWhen he returns from vacation, the president's most important assignment should be to take a deep breath and get a long-term view of the country's reaction to his policies.\n\nSince World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama. His economic policies are not creating jobs. His energy tax is unlikely to pass the Senate. There is an overwhelming rejection of his spending policies.\n\nOn the international front, Afghanistan is proving much harder than expected. Iran is showing no signs of giving up its nuclear program and North Korea is still unyielding.\n\nIn this setting, the left's health program is bitterly dividing the country. Several polls have shown that more Americans expect their personal health-care situation to get worse than to get better under the plan being considered in Congress.\n\nStill, Obama's left-wing advisers want him to undertake the revolutionary act of ramming through massive change for ## percent of the economy under a narrow budgetary provision. This would be a statement of absolute defiance of the vast majority of Americans.\n\nObama faces a choice: He can attempt to run a left-wing government against the American people. Or he can govern from the center with a large majority of Americans supporting him. He can have either his left angry or the American people angry. We will know in September which choice he has made.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE\n\nAuthor and political commentator; manager of Al Gore's #### presidential campaign\n\nPresident Obama must reset the national debate and narrow his focus on passing health-insurance reform with or without Republicans. To do this, the president must convince deficit-weary voters that reform will not send the national debt soaring and that higher taxes on the middle class are not just around the corner.\n\nWith everything in his inbox still marked urgent, the president needs to prioritize more and stop trying to do everything at once without also reminding Americans of the sacrifices involved. He should repeat: Remember, we are all in this together.\n\nObama must also take a chapter from his campaign and begin to work on the new politics that would allow him to reach bipartisan consensus on a host of major challenges.\n\nMuch of the real anger we are seeing is economic anxiety that ordinary people are experiencing in this jobless recession. The economy is doing better, according to statistics, but nobody feels it yet. That makes for a lot of fear and worry.\n\nThe administration should also keep an eye on the stimulus spending: target funds, track job creation, rebuild the safety net, and eliminate waste and duplicity. With money so tight, no one wants to see the government spending frivolously.\n\nROBERT J. BLENDON\n\nProfessor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard's School of Public Health and its Kennedy School of Government\n\nMost Americans do not see the president's economic policies as having been particularly successful for people like themselves, and this is leading to some skepticism about health-care reform. In fact, recent polls show most Americans do not anticipate any aspect of their health care improving if the president's health-reform proposals were enacted.\n\nTo shift this thinking requires two things: The administration's message has to change sharply, focusing on more concrete, practical aspects of reform and how it will improve typical Americans' experiences with health care. Obama needs to present over and over again five specific changes in the legislation that will help the average family, and how they will be paid for. For example, explain why changing the system so families cannot lose their insurance coverage and enacting tough insurance reforms helps families who have coverage today.\n\nSecond, the president needs to make a clear decision this fall about whether he supports a public option competing with private insurance. If so, he must explain how it would function in practice. Americans in the political center are turned off by ideological debates. After all these months, they want him to explain if it is essential and then move on to other issues they see as important.\n\nCHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN\n\nChair of the Republican Leadership Council; governor of New Jersey from #### to ####\n\nIf he wants to regain ground on the health-care debate, climate change and the other legislative initiatives he has identified, President Obama needs to start by rebuilding some bridges within his party. The squabbling among Democrats is bitter, with the attacks from the more liberal end of the party on the more moderate Blue Dog Democrats reaching a fever pitch. Obama might keep in mind the legacy of Sen. Edward Kennedy and reach out to those Blue Dog Democrats as well as moderate Republicans to find common ground. Kennedy was an ardent partisan with a ## percent liberal lifetime voting rating from the liberal watchdog group Americans for Democratic Action. No one questioned his commitment to the liberal agenda or his party. Yet few senators have ever authored more bipartisan bills and were known for so consistently reaching across the aisle. The president should refuse to push through legislation on strictly partisan votes and should seek the types of bipartisan compromise he promised to broker.\n\nDAN SCHNUR\n\nDirector of the University of Southern California's Unruh Institute of Politics; communications director for John McCain's #### presidential campaign\n\nEveryone is drawing political lessons from the life and legacy of Ted Kennedy. But there is one missed opportunity in particular from Kennedy's career that Barack Obama can reflect on to get himself and his administration back on track.\n\nKennedy famously cited his decision to reject President Richard Nixon's health-care reform package as his greatest regret. Although Nixon's proposal was not nearly as ambitious as Kennedy would have preferred, the senator realized over the years that working with Nixon would have led to significant advancements toward his larger goals.\n\nFast-forward to today's battle over health care. It's clear that Obama deserves credit for moving the debate forward and achieving consensus on a number of previously intractable issues. Set aside, for now, the brawls about end-of-life counseling and a publicly funded option. If Obama signed a bill that allows individuals who change jobs to keep their insurance, forbids the denial of coverage for preexisting conditions, and deals with a lifetime cap on benefits, people will throw rose petals at his feet.\n\nImportant progress can be made now on health care; after the most significant reforms in a generation are signed into law, he can still come back to the negotiating table and continue to move forward.\n\nED ROGERS\n\nChairman of BGR Group; White House staffer to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush\n\nWhile the president's effectiveness is eroding, the situation is not dire. He can regain the initiative, but an eloquent speech will not do it. I assume he will not convert to conservatism and abandon his flawed plans, but he should cut his losses and get back to reality.\n\nOccasionally all White Houses contort themselves into situations where they begin to say things they know are not true. The more you say such things, the more you have to keep saying them to try and make them true. But the Obama administration needs to face it: The president's energy bill is not a jobs bill! His health-care plans will lead to government bureaucratic decisions about individuals' heath care and will cost a fortune. The deficit is not under control. The administration should not deny the obvious or defend the indefensible. White House officials know they are losing the public debate on these issues and must scale back to what is possible and credible given America's economic circumstances -- or use brute force in Congress to pass unpopular, harmful and vast new programs.\n\nEven if he did use his congressional majorities to win these battles, the president would lose the war by slowing economic growth, only resulting in more political pain for himself and his party. Obama does not have any political problems that a couple of years of # percent GDP growth will not solve. But he has to want it, and he needs honest policies to achieve it. Now, though, he is on a course that terrifies his political handlers and his party's candidates.\n\nHAROLD FORD JR.\n\nChairman of the Democratic Leadership Council\n\nEvery president faces a time when poll numbers slide. It's easy to advise a president to ignore the numbers and plow ahead. It's not wise for a president to heed that advice blindly. Thankfully, President Obama knows that politics is about the art of the possible.\n\nObama is battling a stubborn recession, a Republican Congress hell-bent on defeating health reform and a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. When he returns to Washington the president should forge a consensus in Congress to pass what is possible on health reform, redouble his efforts to stimulate job creation, clearly articulate our mission objectives in Afghanistan, and redefine and revive energy and financial services reform.\n\nFirst he needs to win on health reform. Obama has been patient, committed and focused on leading Congress to a consensus. At his core, this president is a pragmatist. In the spirit of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, Obama should work toward winning a compromise here before taking on new reform challenges.\n\nThe compromise should be built around insurance reform, such as prohibiting companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions, and guaranteeing coverage for every child in America. Such substantive health reform would put us firmly on path to solving the uninsured problem in this country when our economy gets back on track.\n\nED GILLESPIE\n\nCounselor to President George W. Bush\n\nBarack Obama faces a fundamental decision about the direction of his presidency: Try to muscle through with Democratic votes a much more liberal agenda than many of his voters expected of him, or seek more consensus-oriented policies that attract at least a slice of the House and Senate Republicans by sacrificing core liberal elements of his policies.\n\nIf he chooses the former, he risks spectacular failure or a victory that eliminates the postpartisan persona that is a critical component of his personal approval ratings. This would make it much more difficult to achieve future legislative goals, in the same way the rushed, forced passage of the stimulus bill has made his health-care policy harder to achieve. And once that critical attribute is lost, it's all but impossible to get back.\n\nTo pull his young presidency back from the brink, and protect his greatest asset, President Obama would be wise to tack back to the center and pull his congressional leadership with him. He can then return his focus to the central issue on which voters are looking to him for leadership -- turning our economy around."

    "text": "Well the time for bickering is over. The time for games has passed. Now is the season for action. Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together, and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do. Now is the time to deliver on health care.\n\nThe plan i am announcing tonight would meet three basic goals:\n\nIt will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance to those who do not. And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government. It's a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge \u2013 not just government and insurance companies, but employers and individuals. And it's a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen; from Democrats and Republicans \u2013 and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.\n\nHere are the details that every American needs to know about this plan:\n\nFirst, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have. Let me repeat this: nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.\n\nWhat this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies \u2013 because there is no reason we should not be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives.\n\nthat is what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan \u2013 more security and stability.\n\nNow, if you are one of the tens of millions of Americans who do not currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange \u2013 a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we have given ourselves.\n\nFor those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who cannot get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it."

    "text": "At #:## PM EST on Jan. ##, ####, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small\u2014just # ft. long\u2014a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly ##,### mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft.\n\nIt was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly ##,### mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and\u2014boom\u2014obliterated it. It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path, says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs.\n\nFor China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space, says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we are not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You do not just go and blow things up there. In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of anti\u00c2\u00adsatellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.\n\nINTERNATIONAL THREAT\n\nFor many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. Space debris is a huge problem, says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. A #-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed. Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at ## times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as ##,### of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the #-cm range. Nearly #### pieces were ## cm and larger.\n\nAlthough the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officials\u2014reluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillance\u2014chose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these ##-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth.\n\nBattlefield: Space\n\n#] Songlin test facility, near Xichang, Sichuan province, China. Publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by China prior to the test; immediately following, they were declassified.\n\n#] Experts believe a four-stage, solid\u00c2\u00ad-fuel launch vehicle\u2014thought by American officials to be based on China's KT-#\u2014boosted the kill vehicle into orbit.\n\n#] The Feng-Yun #C target vehicle was launched May ##, ####, with a two-year active life span. The ####-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two ##-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation.\n\n#] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly ##,### mph when it struck the satellite.\n\n#] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within # hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe.\n\nSome details of China's ASAT test are classified. Our artist relied on published reports, declassified information and comparable technology to create this graphic. The Chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. (Diagram by Golden Section Graphics. Inset satellite photograph by Digital Globe.)\n\nNASA\n\nAMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS\n\nEvery industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones.\n\nSome satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft -- including spy sats -- are in low Earth orbit, which stretches #### miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about ##,### miles. Many communications sats are in the ##,###-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile -- yet it can be done. You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over, says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. You'd need ICBM-size boosters -- hundreds of them.\n\nSuch an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. There'd be so much debris up there, Clark says, that it would not be safe to put anything up in space.\n\nThe United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. The consensus, Clark says, was that anybody could look at anybody else.\n\nDiagram: China's antisatellite strike took place at an altitude of ### miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in ####, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a #.#-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of ### miles. The explosion, which occurred about ### miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites -- roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out ### streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately.\n\nTo develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May ##, ####, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of ### miles.\n\nOver the next several decades the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In #### the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-## fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was cancelled before the air-launched system could be perfected.\n\nThat same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In ####, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year.\n\nSome $### million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle -- a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested, and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high.\n\nDestroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at Global\u00c2\u00adSecurity says, It's an act of war.\n\nU.S. Sat Kill Arsenal\n\n--Davin Coburn\n\n#] Perhaps the most spectacular test -- known as Starfish Prime -- occurred on July #, ####, when a #.#-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated ### miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for ## minutes.\n\n#] The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in ####, when an F-## climbed to ##,### ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a ##,###-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly ### miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n\n#] In #### the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy, and eventually canceled the program.\n\n#] The XSS-## microsatellite is not an antisat -- but it could be. First launched in April ####, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it would not be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets.\n\nSENDING A MESSAGE\n\nSo why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. The experiment is not targeted at any other country, said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing.\n\nSome experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified #### U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that The United States considers space capabilities ... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so ... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests.\n\nThe United States basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies, Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the ##st state.\n\nIn that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties, says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength.\n\nPike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island.\n\nThe Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real, Pike says. Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there will not be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time. A half-dozen sats, Pike says -- that is all it would take. Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer.\n\nIn that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its own war plan is feasible.\n\nAMERICA'S TRUMP CARD\n\nThe long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. It was a mistake, O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, It does not help China's case saying it is not a threatening military power, Vick says. It is a threat, and the test showed that. Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat and China has only ## satellites -- few of these are worth shooting down.\n\nAmerica's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all -- they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, just nothing to shoot at.\n\nFor now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier.\n\nWaste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only ## hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude.\n\nJULY ####\n\nJANUARY ####\n\nIt's called the Kessler Syndrome -- the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay, says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. We cannot track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know. The graphic at left illustrates the density of junk in orbit up to an altitude of ##,### miles -- and Kessler's looming threat. -- Erin McCarthy\n\nThe debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about #### miles.A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from ##-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites.\n\nSource: Analysis courtesy of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation/Analytical Graphics, Inc. Data as of April ##, ####. Objects greatly magnified for visibility.\n\nLitter Kings Sad to say, but some space junk -- such as spent boosters -- simply comes with the territory. Other flotsam results from indifference or lousy planning, such as the bags of garbage Soviet cosmonauts jettisoned from the MIR space station for ## years. Here's how the three busiest space players stack up.\n\nUnited States: Topping the list, most U.S. space junk comes from the upper stages of sat launch vehicles.\n\nRussia: The relatively low ratio of debris to satellites will soon change: The explosion of a Russian rocket over Australia in February appears to have produced approximately #### pieces of fresh debris.\n\nChina: Its January sat kill made it the top space polluter per satellite. Almost ## percent of that debris will be in orbit in ### years, says Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. It shows how badly they messed things up with one event. -- E.M.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

    "text": "One out of every four Pennsylvania households is affected by addiction. More than #,### Pennsylvanians died from overdoses last year, making it the leading cause of accidental death in our Commonwealth.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about ### Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms. More than # million Americans abuse prescription drugs or painkillers; another ###,### use heroin.\n\nThese facts are shocking, but they reflect the reality right here in our neighborhoods, in Reading, in Lancaster City, and across Pennsylvania. It is happening to Democrats and Republicans, to people of every race and religion. It happens to our friends, family members, and neighbors. We all know them. And we share their pain.\n\nNo one suffers alone. We don\u2019t have the option to think of this as merely a private or personal issue. Every addict comes from a family, and has people who love them and suffer with them. It can be almost unbearable to watch someone you love endure the physical and mental effects of drug abuse. Every addiction hurts not only an addict, but an entire community.\n\nAll of us pay the price of addiction, too, because it keeps people from fulfilling their potential and contributing more fully to our society. Drug abuse contributes to unemployment, homelessness, and sex trafficking. It puts pressure on government programs and budgets.\n\nNinety percent of addicts who need treatment don\u2019t get it. Our health care system is failing not only them, but it is failing all of us. Addiction is treatable. We need to treat it, and we need to educate our young people properly in order to prevent the spread of addiction.\n\nAt a time when political acrimony is reaching a record level, leaders in both parties are coming together to find solutions. At the state level, Governor Wolf has ordered every state police vehicle to carry naloxone, an anti-overdose drug that has already saved hundreds of lives.\n\nCongress likewise is working on a bipartisan basis, with the support of the Obama Administration, to make the system work better.\n\nThis week, the Senate passed comprehensive legislation to address the addiction crisis. The bill was the result of bipartisan effort, and passed with bipartisan support from both of Pennsylvania\u2019s Senators.\n\nIn November, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bipartisan bill, the Protecting Our Infants Act, to review federal programs to help the newborns of heroin and opiate addicts. Tragically, thousands of babies are exposed to and addicted to drugs like codeine, morphine, or heroin before they are even born. Doctors are able to take these babies through the withdrawal process, however. Our new law will require the federal government to develop a strategy to address any gaps in current research or programs.\n\nIn ####, the Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held five hearings on the drug abuse crisis. In October, as Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, I chaired a two-part hearing at which we heard from experts like the Obama Administration\u2019s drug czar Michael Botticelli and Dr. Kenneth Katz of the Lehigh Valley Health Network.\n\nTheir testimony was as chilling as it was informative. Director Botticelli testified that over the past decade, the number of people treated for overdoses each year, and the number of babies born with neo-natal abstinence syndrome have both tripled. Dr. Katz told us about a number of adolescents in Allentown whom he has seen hospitalized and even killed after trying a new synthetic strand of cannabis.\n\nAt the hearing, we discussed seven bipartisan proposals that would improve federal public health policies and help addicts get treatment. Each of these seven bills deals with a different aspect of the epidemic, because we need a comprehensive plan: not just adequate funding, but targeted funding; not just emergency response, but education and prevention.\n\nThese bills would make a number of changes to existing law. They would expand the number of physicians who can prescribe the drug buprenorphine to addicts, develop best practices and a national awareness campaign, ban certain synthetic drugs, help pregnant women who are addicted, and create a patient tracking pilot program.\n\nWe aren\u2019t finished. Congress will continue to take action on behalf of the families and communities across Pennsylvania and across the country being shattered by this public health crisis. We will work until the system works.\n\n###"

    "text": "Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points \u2014 resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.\n\nClinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee ## percent to ## percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus-or-minus #.# percentage points. In April, Clinton held an ##-point advantage over Trump, ## percent to ## percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December.\n\nIn a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by ## points, ## percent to ## percent.\n\nLooking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (## percent to # percent), Latinos (## percent to ## percent), women (## percent to ## percent) and those ages ## to ## (## percent to ## percent).\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (## percent to ## percent), seniors (## percent to ## percent), men (## percent to ## percent) and independents (## percent to ## percent).\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll \u2014 conducted May ##-## \u2014 comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days.\n\nRepublicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an ## percent-to-# percent margin, which is up from ## percent to ## percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee.\n\nComplete Coverage: Decision ####\n\nWhile Democrats are backing Clinton by an ## percent-to-# percent clip, just ## percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with ## percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest). Those numbers underscore Clinton\u2019s challenge in winning over Sanders voters once the Democratic primary contest concludes.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Unpopular\n\nTrump and Clinton are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll.\n\nThirty four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus ## percent who have a negative opinion (-##) \u2014 a slight uptick from her minus-## score last month.\n\nTrump's rating is even worse than Clinton\u2019s: Twenty nine percent have a positive opinion of him, while ## percent have a negative opinion (-##) \u2014 an improvement from his minus-## score in April.\n\n\u201cThis has never been matched, or even close to being matched,\u201d Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, says of these negative ratings for Trump and Clinton.\n\nBy contrast, Sanders is in positive territory. Forty-three percent have a positive view of the Vermont senator, versus ## percent who have a negative view (+#). One difference Clinton and Sanders: Clinton\u2019s rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is ## percent positive, ## percent negative (-#); Sanders\u2019 rating among Clinton supporters is ## percent positive, ## percent negative (+##).\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s overall score in the current NBC/WSJ poll is at ## percent positive, ## percent negative (+#).\n\nForty Seven Percent Would Consider a Third-Party Candidate\n\nAsked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, ## percent of registered voters say yes -- a higher percentage than those who said yes on a similar question in #### and ####.\n\nFifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate.\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll was conducted May ##-## of #,### registered voters, including ### cell phone-only respondents and another ## reached on a cell but who also have a landline.

    "text": "- June ##, #### -\n\nDonald J. Trump on the Stakes of the Election\n\nDownload PDF\n\nToday I\u2018d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.\n\nPeople have asked me why I am running for President.\n\nI have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.\n\nWe come to work together and turn visions into reality.\n\nWe think big, and then we make it happen.\n\nI love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.\n\nSo when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.\n\nWhen I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton \u2013 only by me.\n\nThe fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!\n\nEverywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can\u2019t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\n\nWe will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.\n\nThe insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re asking Bernie Sanders\u2019 voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.\n\nBecause it\u2019s not just the political system that\u2019s rigged. It\u2019s the whole economy.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged against you, the American people.\n\nHillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar \u2013\n\njust look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.[#]\n\nBrian Williams\u2019 career was destroyed for saying far less.\n\nYesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over ## billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.\n\nI am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.\n\nWe are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.\n\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.\n\nHere is my promise to the American voter:\n\nIf I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests \u2013 and taking money from special interests.\n\nHillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.\n\nShe ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund \u2013 doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.\n\nThen, when she left, she made $##.# million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests \u2013 in less than # years \u2013 secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. [#] [#]\n\nTogether, she and Bill made $### million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since ####.[#]\n\nThey totally own her, and that will never change.\n\nThe choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.\n\nThose are the stakes.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to be President. But she does not have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.\n\nShe believes she is entitled to the office.\n\nHer campaign slogan is \u201cI\u2019m with her.\u201d\n\nYou know what my response to that is? I\u2019m with you : the American people.\n\nShe thinks it\u2019s all about her.\n\nI know it\u2019s all about you \u2013 I know it\u2019s all about making America Great Again for All Americans.\n\nOur country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.\n\nWe got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism \u2013 focusing on what\u2019s good for America\u2019s middle class \u2013 to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.\n\nWe reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.\n\nThis is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nThis is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.\n\nWe need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.\n\nThat\u2019s what we mean by America First.\n\nOur country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.\n\nOur Founders understood this.\n\nOne of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for \u201cthe encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]\u201d in America.[#]\n\nOur first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:\n\n\u201cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d[#]\n\nI have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nHillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton\u2019s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization.[#]\n\nWe\u2019ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.[#]\n\nOur trade deficit with China soared ##% during Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.[#]\n\nThen she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property \u2013 a crime which is continuing to this day.[##]\n\nHillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.\n\nIn return, Hillary Clinton got rich!\n\nThe book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America\u2019s expense.\n\nShe gets rich making you poor.\n\nHere is a quote from the book: \u201cAt the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton\u2026at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.\u201d\n\nThese funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.[##]\n\nShe sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.\n\nHillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas \u2013 and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.[##]\n\nNow, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book \u2013 deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least ##,### emails are missing.)[##]\n\nBut this latest Clinton cover-up doesn\u2019t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career \u2013 and it will be even worse than the Clintons\u2019 NAFTA deal.\n\nI want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.\n\nWe do not make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.\n\nIt\u2019s not just our economy that\u2019s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars \u2013 and unleashed ISIS across the world.\n\nNo Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.\n\nHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.\n\nAmong the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that is right, when the phone rang at # o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.\n\nAmbassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.[##]\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department refused them all.\n\nShe started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.\n\nTo cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.[##]\n\nHere is what one of the victim\u2019s mothers had to say:\n\n\u201cI want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don\u2019t want this person to be president.\u201d[##]\n\nIn ####, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.\n\nLibya was cooperating.\n\nIraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\n\nSyria was under control.\n\nIran was being choked by sanctions.\n\nEgypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.\n\nISIS wasn\u2019t even on the map.\n\nFast forward to ####: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed\n\nto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.\n\nHer invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.\n\nThanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen \u2013 while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.[##]\n\nShe helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora\u2019s box of radical Islam.\n\nThen, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.[##]\n\nISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.\n\nISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality \u2013 and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.\n\nIn short, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.\n\nIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.[##]\n\nThough I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.[##]\n\nBut Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn\u2019t wait to rush us off to war in Libya.\n\nShe lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.\n\nIn the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:\n\n\u201cShe simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve\n\nin the office\u2026from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true\u2026Her leadership style \u2013 volcanic, impulsive\u2026disdainful of the rules set for everyone else \u2013 hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d[##]\n\nPerhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.\n\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical ###% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that is an increase over President Obama's already very high number.[##]\n\nUnder her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth \u2013 with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.[##] [##]\n\nAlready, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.[##]\n\nThe father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.[##]\n\nI only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.\n\nMaybe her motivation lies among the more than #,### foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.[##]\n\nHillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.\n\nHere is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:\n\nA foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $###,### for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.[##]\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved the transfer of ##% of America\u2019s uranium holdings to Russia, while # investors in the deal funneled $### million to the Clinton Foundation.[##]\n\nHillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access \u2013 even though he had no national security credentials.[##]\n\nHillary Clinton accepted $##,### in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State \u2013 plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. [##]\n\nHillary Clinton took up to $## million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.[##]\n\nHillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.[##]\n\nTo cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.\n\nHer server was easily hacked by foreign governments \u2013 perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China \u2013 putting all of America in danger.[##]\n\nThen there are the ##,### emails she deleted.[##]\n\nWhile we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.\n\nSo they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.\n\nThis fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.\n\nWe can\u2019t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.\n\nNational security is also immigration security \u2013 and Hillary wants neither.\n\nHillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.\n\nShe has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first ### days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.[##]\n\nThe first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.\n\nLet me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.\n\nShe lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.[##]\n\nSadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.\n\nHere is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza\u2019s letter:\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms\u2019 way \u2013 an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.\u201d\n\nHillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.\n\nFor the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.\n\nHillary\u2019s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can\u2019t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.\n\nHere are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first ### days:\n\nAppoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton\u2019s radical judges will virtually abolish the #nd amendment.\n\nChange immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs\n\nStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many\n\nCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas\n\nLift restrictions on energy production\n\nRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.\n\nPass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.\n\nImpose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.\n\nThere is one common theme in all of these reforms.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be America First.\n\nThis is why the stakes in November are so great.\n\nOn Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.\n\nThe voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don\u2019t need or want another Clinton or Obama.\n\nCome November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.\n\nThey will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s message is old and tired. Her message is that can\u2019t change.\n\nMy message is that things have to change \u2013 and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.\n\nAmericans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.\n\nThen we started thinking small.\n\nWe stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.\n\nWe lost our sense of purpose, and daring.\n\nBut that\u2019s not who we are.\n\nCome this November, we can bring America back \u2013 bigger and better, and stronger than ever.\n\nWe will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth \u2013 the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.\n\nOur military will have the best technology and finest equipment \u2013 we will bring it back all the way.\n\nMassive new factories will come roaring into our country \u2013 breathing life and hope into our communities.\n\nInner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.\n\nConstruction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.\n\nThe real wages for our workers have not been raised for ## years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary\u2019s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.\n\nWe are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.\n\nI am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.\n\nOur country is going to start working again.\n\nPeople are going to start working again.\n\nParents are going to start dreaming big for their children again \u2013 including parents in our inner cities.\n\nAmericans are going to start believing in the future or our country.\n\nWe are going to make America rich again.\n\nWe are going to make America safe again.\n\nWe are going to make America Great Again \u2013 and Great Again For EVERYONE .\n\n\n\n\n\n[#] (\u201cSen.

    "text": "By PolitiFact staff\n\nPolitiFact is annotating the second presidential debate at Washington University. We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.\n\nRADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?\n\nCLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.\n\nAnd I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.\n\nI have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.\n\nIf we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.\n\nI want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.\n\nTRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, ## percent, ## percent, ## percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $### billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.\n\nWhen I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $### billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $### billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable.\n\nYou say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going the make great deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.\n\nBut I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\u2019s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?\n\nTRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\n\nYou know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have \u2014 and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.\n\nAnd they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on.\n\nYes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.\n\nCOOPER: So, Mr. Trump\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.\n\nCOOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus ## years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?\n\nTRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.\n\nCOOPER: So, for the record, you\u2019re saying you never did that?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.\n\nCOOPER: Have you ever done those things?\n\nTRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe. We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.\n\nWe\u2019re going to make America safe again. We\u2019re going to make America great again, but we\u2019re going to make America safe again. And we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don\u2019t do that, it just \u2014 it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: And that\u2019s what I want to talk about.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\n\nCLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last ## hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\n\nDonald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.\n\nSo, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.\n\nSo this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why \u2014 to go back to your question \u2014 I want to send a message \u2014 we all should \u2014 to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.\n\nCLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president.\n\nRADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.\n\nRADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s just words, folks. It\u2019s just words. Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.\n\nI\u2019ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.\n\nShe\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump \u2014 I want to get to audience questions and online questions.\n\nTRUMP: So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond?\n\nRADDATZ: You\u2019re going to have \u2014 you\u2019re going to get to respond right now.\n\nTRUMP: Sounds fair.\n\nRADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just ## hours, it\u2019s become the single most talked about story of the entire #### election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \u201cTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\u201d So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age ##, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.\n\nTRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it. But that was something that happened.\n\nIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\n\nHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at ## years old, was raped at ##. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.\n\nSo don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $###,### fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.\n\nAnd I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said ## years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.\n\nWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.\n\n(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.\n\nCLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.\n\nHe never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201d\n\nHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.\n\nNumber two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\n\nSo, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\n\nBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the ##,### s that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of s and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor.\n\nWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where s \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete ##,### s, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to let you talk about s.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: In the first debate\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nRADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people.\n\nSo, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump \u2014 you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we\u2019ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\n\nTRUMP: Because you\u2019d be in jail.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You\u2019re just wasting time.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You\u2019ve said your handing of your s was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The FBI said that there were ### classified s that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those s. You don\u2019t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said before, but I\u2019ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it \u2014 that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal  account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all \u2014 anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2014 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nI take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, we\u2019re going to move on.\n\nTRUMP: And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document. Right? She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m watching Hillary go over facts. And she\u2019s going after fact after fact, and she\u2019s lying again, because she said she \u2014 you know, what she did with the  was fine. You think it was fine to delete ##,### s? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nShe said the ##,### s had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we\u2019ll give three or three or four or five or something. ##,### s deleted, and now she\u2019s saying there wasn\u2019t anything wrong.\n\nAnd more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.\n\nOur Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for ## minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting ##,### s, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did \u2014 and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move on.\n\nTRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.\n\nRADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.\n\nTRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.\n\nCLINTON: Look, it\u2019s just not true. And so please, go to\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond, please.\n\nCLINTON: It was personal s, not official.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, ##,###? Yeah.\n\nCLINTON: Not \u2014 well, we turned over ##,###, so\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other ##,###?\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t talk while you talked.\n\nCLINTON: Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t.\n\nTRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.\n\nCLINTON: I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.\n\nTRUMP: Get off this question.\n\nCLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let\u2019s at least focus\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Let\u2019s see what happens\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let\u2019s get to their questions.\n\nCOOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the s? I\u2019d like to know. Why aren\u2019t you bringing\u2026\n\nCOOPER: We brought up the s.\n\nTRUMP: No, it hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t. And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all.\n\nCOOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?\n\nCOOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.\n\nCLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.\n\nTRUMP: No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that ## million got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.\n\nBut everybody else, the ### million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.\n\nNumber three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under ##, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of ##, something that didn\u2019t happen before.\n\nSo I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.\n\nRight now, we are at ## percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: So I want us to get to ### percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care.\n\nIt\u2019s only getting worse. In \u2019##, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $## trillion in debt.\n\nObamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.\n\nWe have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want \u2014 and President Obama and whoever was working on it \u2014 they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.\n\nYou will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways.\n\nBut she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, your time\u2026\n\nTRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \u201cthe craziest thing in the world,\u201d saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?\n\nCLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\u2019s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.\n\nAnd the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.\n\nThat was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, ## million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\u2019s not going to work.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want \u2014 just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything\u2019s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare\u2026\n\nTRUMP: By the way\u2026\n\nCOOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\u2019ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\u2019re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?\n\nTRUMP: We\u2019re going to be able to. You\u2019re going to have plans\u2026\n\nCOOPER: What does that mean?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means. You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Are you going \u2014 are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?\n\nTRUMP: President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that can\u2019t get \u2014 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected.\n\nAnd Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\u2019re going to block grant into the states. We\u2019re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. There are #.# million Muslims in the United States, and I\u2019m one of them. You\u2019ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re first.\n\nTRUMP: Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.\n\nAs an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed ## and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.\n\nAnd, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible \u2014 these are radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nAnd she won\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name. But the name is there. It\u2019s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.\n\nI want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.\n\nCLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nIt\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see.\n\nIt\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.\n\nWe are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.\n\nMr. Trump, in December, you said this. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.\n\nThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me..\n\nRADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe\u2026 TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.\n\nRADDATZ: I do.\n\nTRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?\n\nRADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a ### percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants ### percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.\n\nWe have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from ##,### to ##,### Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\u2019s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?\n\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that #-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.\n\nThere are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\n\nBut it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?\n\nSo I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.\n\nAnd the final thing I would say, this is the ##th or ##th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\u2019s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: So, please\u2026\n\nTRUMP: That has not been debunked.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.\n\nTRUMP: I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, I just want to say\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: There\u2019s been lots of fact-checking on that. I\u2019d like to move on to an online question\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about ## seconds over her time.\n\nRADDATZ: She did not.\n\nTRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?\n\nRADDATZ: Very quickly, please.\n\nTRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them. In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\u2019t want them.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\u2019s OK, we can\u2019t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to force them right back into their country. They\u2019re murderers and some very bad people.\n\nAnd I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen.\n\nICE just endorsed me. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, ##,###, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\u2019t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\u2019s a horrible thing she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, two, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the ##th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great \u2014 I thought a great display of presidential leadership.\n\nBut, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.\n\nWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the ##th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\n\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.

And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\n\nCLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re out of time.\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 with the Russians and other foreign powers.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous. Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference.\n\nBut as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin.\n\nBut I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know \u2014 I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.\n\nI have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.\n\nNow, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have \u2014 first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her \u2014 took massive deductions.\n\nI pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But \u2014 but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nCOOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\n\nTRUMP: Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator.\n\nShe complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.\n\nBut \u2014 and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for ## years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.\n\nWe\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving \u2014 massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.\n\nBut we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from ## percent to ## percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.\n\nAnd I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of # percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at # percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important \u2014 one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?\n\nCLINTON: Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe ## years talking about what he\u2019s going to do.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.\n\nNow, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $###,### a year \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know \u2014 will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.\n\nAnd, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.\n\nI want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $# million.\n\nWe have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.\n\nPeople like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nCLINTON: And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you. I want to give you \u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\u2019s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your #### tax returns. They show you claimed a $### million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\u2019ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $### million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?\n\nTRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.\n\nCOOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?\n\nTRUMP: A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\u2019s why.\n\nSee, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\u2019s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and it\u2019s extremely complex \u2014 Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest.\n\nBut I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\u2019t mention their names, because they\u2019re rich, but they\u2019re not famous. So we won\u2019t make them famous.\n\nCOOPER: So can you \u2014 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?\n\nTRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\u2019s given it to us.\n\nHey, if she had a problem \u2014 for ## years she\u2019s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She doesn\u2019t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\u2019s all talk and no action.\n\nCOOPER: In the past\u2026\n\nTRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in ## different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary \u2014 I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, here we go again. I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that\u2019s not the point here.\n\nTRUMP: Why didn\u2019t you do it? Why didn\u2019t you do it?\n\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\n\nCLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.\n\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\n\nCLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nTRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.\n\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t interrupt you.\n\nCLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c## years this and ## years that.\u201d So let me talk about my ## years in public service. I\u2019m very glad to do so.\n\nEight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After #/##, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.\n\nWhen I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.\n\nI worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nCLINTON: I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for ## years, I\u2019ve produced results for people.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.\n\nTRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: No, we can \u2014 no, Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to go on. This is about the audience.\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a #-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\u2019s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with ### million views on Facebook alone.\n\nBut there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, ### people have been killed, at least ### of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.\n\nSo this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\u2019t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about ###,### still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.\n\nRussia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.\n\nI think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which\u2026\n\nCLINTON: No, I wasn\u2019t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point\u2026\n\nTRUMP: OK. But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me. You were\u2026\n\nCLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.\n\nTRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.\n\nObama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.\n\nNow, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.\n\nNow, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.\n\nLook at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster.\n\nBut if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $### billion, with the $#.# billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.\n\nBut look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are. So what\u2019s the purpose?\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: And one thing I have to say.\n\nRADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\n\nTRUMP: OK. He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.\n\nRADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?\n\nTRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.\n\nI believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn\u2019t.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.\n\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?\n\nTRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.\n\nWell, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can\u2019t they do it quietly? Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying? How stupid is our country?\n\nRADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.\n\nTRUMP: I can\u2019t think of any. I can\u2019t think of any. And I\u2019m pretty good at it.\n\nRADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.\n\nTRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have \u2014 look, I have ### generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have ## Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How \u2014 why would these people stay there? I\u2019ve been reading now\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore. They\u2019re gone. Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.\n\nNow, with these ### admirals and generals, they can\u2019t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we\u2019re doing in the Middle East.\n\nRADDATZ: I\u2019m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?\n\nCLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy.\n\nI do think the use of special forces, which we\u2019re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?\n\nCLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Everything.\n\nCLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nThere are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.\n\nI would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference. So I think that could help.\n\nI would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to move on\u2026\n\nTRUMP: You know what\u2019s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her. When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal.\n\nRADDATZ: You had many answers.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting.\n\nCOOPER: We\u2019ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?\n\nQUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?\n\nCOOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.\n\nBecause NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn\u2019t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she\u2019s lied about a lot of things.\n\nTRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities. She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done.\n\nSame with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and \u2014 you see it\u2019s ## percent poverty. African- Americans now ## percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, and I\u2019ve been saying at big speeches where I have ##,### and ##,### people, what do you have to lose? It can\u2019t get any worse. And she\u2019s been talking about the inner cities for ## years. Nothing\u2019s going to ever happen.\n\nLet me tell you, if she\u2019s president of the United States, nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\u2019s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others\u2019 favors, she\u2019s doing me favors.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk. It doesn\u2019t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.\n\nCOOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Well, ## percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.\n\nMr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the ## years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos \u2014 one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.\n\nAnd I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s ## years old now. This is the only one country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?\n\nYou know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear \u2014 in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\n\nSo, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.\n\nCOOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president.\n\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up.\n\nCLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are, quote, \u201cdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\u2019t express regret for using the term \u201cdeplorables.\u201d To Mr. Carter\u2019s question, how can you unite a country if you\u2019ve written off tens of millions of Americans?\n\nCLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.\n\nAnd what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\u2019s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said \u2014 I\u2019m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me ### percent.\n\nCOOPER: Thank you.\n\nCLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates\u2026\n\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.\n\nCOOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.\n\nTRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.\n\nWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in ## years. We have a divided nation, because people like her \u2014 and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\u2019re irredeemable, you didn\u2019t mention that, but when she said they\u2019re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.\n\nCOOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.\n\nTRUMP: She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her.\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In ####, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn\u2019t have it, quote, \u201che or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from # a.m. to # a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\n\nCOOPER: You mentioned sex tape.\n\nTRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said # o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at # o\u2019clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens\u2026\n\nCOOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 ### \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, ### times. Well, she said she was awake at # o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at # o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But she said she\u2019ll be awake. Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at # o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent ### requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.\n\nNow, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost ## million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?\n\nCLINTON: No.\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m shocked to hear that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCLINTON: Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion. It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $### billion deficit and turn it into a $### billion surplus, and ## million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up ## percent.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after #/##, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\u2019ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.\n\nAnd I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.\n\nCOOPER: We have to move along.\n\nCLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to\u2026\n\nCLINTON: Five million homes were lost.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re moving.\n\nCLINTON: And $## trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We\u2019re almost out of time. We have another\u2026 TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since ####.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019re moving to an audience question.\n\nTRUMP: It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWe have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?\n\nRADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: Thank you. Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.\n\nBecause I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that.\n\nI would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\n\nNow, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.\n\nI want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.\n\nSo I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.\n\nI hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You\u2019re out of time. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked ## of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.\n\nBut people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\u2019ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.\n\nNow, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $### million put in \u2014 of my money, meaning I\u2019m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\u2019s doing. What I ask is this.\n\nSo I\u2019m putting in more than \u2014 by the time it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll have more than $### million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\u2019re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\u2019re doing tremendously on the small donations, $## average or so.\n\nI ask Hillary, why doesn\u2019t \u2014 she made $### million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $### million, but why don\u2019t you put $## million or $## million or $## million or $## million into your own campaign?\n\nIt\u2019s $## million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\u2019ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\u2019ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\u2019t you putting money into your own campaign? I\u2019m just curious.\n\nCLINTON: Well\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to get on to one more question.\n\nCLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.\n\nRADDATZ: We have \u2014 we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.\n\nCLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.\n\nCOOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?\n\nQUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?\n\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.\n\nWe are killing \u2014 absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.\n\nAnd you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for #,### years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable \u2014 we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $## trillion in debt.\n\nI will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.\n\nYou take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.\n\nThe EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.\n\nCLINTON: And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\n\nYou know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business \u2014 you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.\n\nSo I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the ##st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\n\nBut I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them.\n\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton\u2026\n\nCLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.\n\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\n\nCLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.\n\nCOOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: We have\u2026\n\nCOOPER: One more audience question.\n\nRADDATZ: We\u2019ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.\n\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?\n\nCLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.\n\nSo I believe that this election has become in part so \u2014 so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent ## years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.\n\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.\n\nI will say this about Hillary. She doesn\u2019t quit. She doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\u2019s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\u2019s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.\n\nCOOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.\n\nRADDATZ: Please tune in on October ##th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone."

Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson\u2019s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of \u2018truth\u2019.\n\n\u2018At best, a photograph of a celebrity reproduces something authentic only at the very moment the shutter clicks\u2019 says the artist \u2018yet we have been teased into giving these moments an absolute and unquestioned authority. However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a \u2018mental image\u2019 rather than a direct record of reality\u2019\n\nJackson\u2019s staging, her subversive form of social commentary which has its historical roots in artist William Hogarth, strips away the veneer of PR and hype that prop up the celebrities that come under her scrutiny. Unlike the paparazzi photo, where the actual real celebrity is caught on film in a frozen moment in time, Jackson\u2019s productions \u2013 where the likenesses are recognisable \u2013 use the celebrity aura to address a deeper universal lineage, the archetypal characters that define the history of human identity and the often humorous struggle of how they cope in the age of mass mediation."

    "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump has long positioned himself as a front-line soldier in the so-called War on Christmas, which made non-Christians justifiably nervous as they anticipated his administration\u2019s first holiday season as a religiously charged, exclusionary and divisive affair.\n\nTo really understand Trump and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz\n\nIndeed, days before the holiday, a pro-Trump video featuring a little blonde girl lisping \u201cThank you, President Trump, for letting us say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 again,\u201d as if the words had somehow been previously banned or outlawed.\n\n>>Netanyahu enlists in Trump's army: Israel is a country that says 'Merry Christmas'\n\nAnd then on Christmas Eve, Trump tweeted that he was proud to have beaten back what he called an assault on the holiday.\n\nThe \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d catchphrase was coined by former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, who claimed in #### that Christmas was \u201cunder siege\u201d by \u201csecular progressives.\u201d It was triggered when the department store Macy\u2019s decided not to greet customers with \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d but to wish them \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d instead.\n\nO\u2019Reilly seized on that as an example of an organized effort to eliminate Christian religious symbols in American public life. He and other right-wing commentators were following in the footsteps of a tradition dating back to the ####s and the far-right John Birch Society, which claimed a communist conspiracy was hell-bent on taking \u201cthe Christ out of Christmas,\u201d also blaming fantatics at the UN for trying to poison the #### Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda.\n\n>>Ex-Marine who plotted San Francisco Christmas attack claims he was angry about Trump 'giving Jerusalem to the Jews'\n\nEven before entering politics, Trump declared that so-called \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d in the name of inclusivity and separation of church and state had gone too far. In ####, Trump went as far as to falsely accuse then-President Barack Obama of failing to send Christmas greetings, while remembering to mark the African festival of Kwanzaa.\n\nIn part of his effort to rally evangelical Christians to his camp, Trump made the issue a running theme during his #### presidential election campaign, repeatedly promising at his rallies that he would \u201cbring back\u201d the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\n>>The Palestinians just gave Netanyahu what he always wanted for Christmas | Analysis\n\nIn November ####, Trump made headlines by proposing a boycott of Starbucks as punishment for manufacturing a red and white holiday cup that wasn\u2019t explicitly Christmassy enough, promising a booing audience: \u201cIf I become president, we\u2019re all going to be saying \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 again. That I can tell you.\u201d\n\nIn his #### post-election victory lap around the country, his travels were officially dubbed the \u201cMerry Christmas USA #### Victory Tour.\u201d A year later, at a rally in Pensacola, Florida, \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d was front and center once again.\n\nBut despite all the hoopla, there has been little explicitly Christian content crossing the church-state line in the Trump era that could truly upset non-Christians.\n\nThere were a few warning signs earlier this month, though. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of evangelical leader and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, invoked Christian belief during her briefing on December #, with a tale designed to \u201cshine a spotlight\u201d on seasonal \u201cgenerosity.\u201d She related the story of St. Matthew\u2019s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia, which follows a century-old tradition of helping families who can\u2019t afford Christmas toys for their children. While Sanders\u2019 story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian. She said that such \u201cstories are important because they remind us what this season is all about and that\u2019s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 message raised eyebrows and comment on social media.\n\nAnother small but significant sign of change was spotted by former White House aide and former ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro, who pointed out that the proclamation declaring Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital signed by Trump had been worded to state that the event was taking place on \u201cthis sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen.\u201d\n\nShapiro noted on Twitter that during his years in the Obama White House, he had \u201cworked hard (with mixed success) to get that standard formulation out of White House proclamations aimed at the Jewish community.\u201d He was referring to the standard language for presidential proclamations, which explicitly state the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ, marking the start of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nBut as the weeks passed and Christmas neared, there wasn\u2019t much to justify concerns that the Trump White House would be transformed into an overtly Christian observance, excluding other religious traditions.\n\nTrue, the Trump Hanukkah party was smaller, more low-key and more partisan than past celebrations in the Bush and Obama White Houses. But the tradition of holding a Hanukkah celebration only began during the second Bush administration, so Trump presumably could have gotten away with eliminating it \u2013 though that might not have sat well with daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nIndeed, Ivanka Trump\u2019s Twitter feed was one of the clearest indicators that the \u201creturn to Merry Christmas\u201d message had not penetrated the culture very deeply.\n\nShe seemed to quite deliberately choose to wish her five million Twitter followers \u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d with no mention of the \u201cC-word,\u201d in what some viewed as outright defiance of her father\u2019s \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d rhetoric.\n\nFor those who would chalk up Ivanka\u2019s Christmas-less greeting to the fact she is Jewish, there was further evidence of the cultural zeitgeist with the fact her younger brother Eric also stayed ecumenical in wishing the best from Trump Winery.\n\nEven Melania Trump\u2019s much publicized \u2013 and much maligned \u2013 choices for decorating the White House felt more pagan than overtly Christian, with many white branches and relatively few representations of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. Yes, there was a cr\u00e8che display in the White House, but there had been one throughout the Obama administration, despite false rumors to the contrary.\n\nAll of this demonstrates the fact that while Trump\u2019s enthusiastic crusade against what he characterizes as a nefarious anti-\u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and pro-\u201cHappy Holidays\u201d conspiracy may play well with his base, his obsession with the issue isn\u2019t at all reflective of mainstream America.\n\nThat feeling is born out with a newly released Pew Research Center survey, which found that far fewer Americans care about being explicitly wished a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d than they had in the past.\n\nThe Pew poll reported: \u201cA rising share of Americans say they do not have a preference about how they are greeted in stores during the holiday season, while a declining percentage prefer to have stores greet them with \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the survey, Americans were previously split down the middle when it came to expressing a preference for \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d over an alternative greeting when they were asked about it more than a decade ago and again in ####.\n\nThis year, more than half of the U.S. public surveyed, ## percent, told pollsters that a business\u2019 choice of holiday greeting did not matter to them, while just a third \u2013 ## percent \u2013 said they preferred that stores and businesses greet customers with \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d during the holidays.\n\nOverall, the Pew survey pointed to the fact that Trump\u2019s election does not reflect a surge in Christian religiosity in America. In fact, it found the religious aspects of Christmas were markedly \u201cdeclining.\u201d\n\nThe number of Americans who believe that the \u201cbiblical account of the birth of Jesus depicts actual events\u201d is \u201cshrinking,\u201d it said, and \u201ca declining majority says religious displays such as nativity scenes should be allowed on government property.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new for Trump to appeal to his core base, and presumably his \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d obsession shores up his status with evangelicals \u2013 even as it flies in the face of the sentiments of the majority of Americans, who seem happy to celebrate any holiday and don\u2019t care much how it\u2019s expressed. For many, the politicization of what is supposed to be a greeting of seasonal cheer is simply confusing.\n\nIn a blow to the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d theory from one of Trump\u2019s least favorite religious minorities, comedian Feraz Ozel compiled video of Muslim-American families wishing their countrymen a Merry Christmas in order to demonstrate that non-Christians were just fine with the phrase.\n\n\u201cPlenty of Muslims and brown folks from different religions are still happy to wish you a \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 if the time is right,\u201d Ozel said. \u201cJust because some people say \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to people who don\u2019t celebrate it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not happy to wish you a very Merry Christmas also.\u201d"

The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of ##- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.\n\nMany are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In ####, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.\n\nMembers of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately #,### motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately ##%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.\n\nWhen asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below ##-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, \u201cThis is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least ##-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for ##-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to ##-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of ##-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.\u201d\n\nAccording to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding ##-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to ##-##-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.\n\nOfficials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January ####, however may file for a temporary ##, ##, or ##-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.\n\nAccording to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $## to the consumer.\n\nLittleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.\n\nJust two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX # has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.\n\nRod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.\n\nNow, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.\n\nWheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\n\nThe police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey have not been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, \u201cAbsolutely. Yeah. that is confirmed.\n\nWheeler also told us, I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, \u2018Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can\u2019t share any information with you.\u2019 Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don\u2019t think it comes from the chief\u2019s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].\n\nA full report with the new details will air Tuesday morning on FOX News."

Obama decided your fallen didn\u2019t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn\u2019t be offended.

    "text": "Submitted by Mac Slavo via SHTFPlan.com,\n\nCall it conspiracy theory, coincidence or just bad luck, but any time someone is in a position to bring down Hillary Clinton by testifying they wind up dead. In fact, there\u2019s a long history of Clinton-related body counts, with scores of people dying under mysterious circumstances.\n\nPerhaps the most notable is Vince Foster. Foster was a partner at Clinton\u2019s law firm and knew the inner workings of the Clinton Machine. Police ruled that death a suicide, though it is often noted that Foster may have been suicided.\n\nNow, another official has found himself on the wrong end of the Clintons. That John Ashe was a former President of the United Nations General Assembly highlights the fact that no one is safe once in their sights.\n\nAnd as you might have guessed, there are major inconsistencies with Ashe\u2019s death. It was not only conveniently timed because Ashe died just a few days before being set to testify against Clinton in a corruption case, but official reports indicated he died of a heart attack.\n\nThe problem, however, is that police on the scene reported Ashe died when his throat was crushed during a work-out accident.\n\nThe New York Post\u2019s Page Six reported that after Ashe was found dead Wednesday, the U.N. claimed that he had died from a heart attack. Local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York, later disputed that claim, saying instead that he died from a workout accident that crushed his throat. Adding to the mysterious nature of Ashe\u2019s death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court Monday with his Chinese businessman co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, from whom he reportedly received over $# billion in donations during his term as president of the U.N. General Assembly. And then there was this: During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Seng illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the Democrat National Committee. Source: The Conservative Tribune via The Daily Sheeple\n\nIt must be coincidence, right?\n\nIf former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne is to be believed, this is business as usual for the Clintons. Excerpt via Zero Hedge:\n\nBYRNE: I feel so strongly that people need to know the real Hillary Clinton and how dangerous she is in her behavior. She is not a leader. She is not a leader. SEAN: She does not have the temperament? BYRNE: She doesn\u2019t have the temperament. She didn\u2019t have the temperament to handle the social office when she was First Lady, she does not have the temperament. SEAN: She\u2019s dishonest. BYRNE: She\u2019s dishonest, she habitually lies, anybody that can separate themselves from their politics and review her behavior over the past ## years\u2026\n\nByrne is the author of the newly published book Crisis Of Character \u2013 a first-hand Clinton expos\u00e9."

In the real image, Gonz\u00e1lez is ripping apart a gun-range target.\n\nThe doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.\n\nThe animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.\n\nHe tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading \u201c#Vorw\u00e4rts!\u201d \u2014 the German word for \u201cforward\u201d and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.\n\nGab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than ###,### followers, then hours later asserted it was \u201csatire.\u201d It racked up more than #,### retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.\n\nThe pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.\n\nDonald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: \u201cJust a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),\u201d referencing a user named \u201cLinda NRA Supporter\u201d who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.\n\nMoynihan\u2019s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.\n\nGenerally, one form of criticism of Gonz\u00e1lez and fellow students such as David Hogg, ##, has focused on their ages.\n\nThey are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right\u2019s criticism of Hogg\u2019s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.\n\nThe online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first \u201ctop news\u201d video that appears in a YouTube search for \u201cDavid Hogg\u201d is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to not just go after this kid,\u201d host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.\n\nOther elements of Gonz\u00e1lez have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.\n\nFor instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.\n\n\u201cEmma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,\u201d one meme shared on Reddit\u2019s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).\n\n\u201cThis is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don\u2019t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,\u201d said a post on King\u2019s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of Gonz\u00e1lez at the podium Saturday.\n\nA self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics \u2014 a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, ##, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.\n\n\u201cThe initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it\u2019s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. \u2018Boycott this, boycott that.\u2019 It\u2019s detracting from the actual discussions,\u201d Kashuv told The Post\u2019s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.\n\nSince then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.\n\nBut he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.\n\nHogg\u2019s comments at the rally were \u201cegregious and inflammatory,\u201d Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg\u2019s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.\n\nConservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.\n\n\u201cYou will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?\u201d Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.\n\nAbby Ohlheiser contributed to this report, which has been updated."

Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.\n\nJohn added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: I do not really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign.\n\ni am British. i have met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, i am not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.\n\nAndrea Bocelli\n\n(Getty)\n\nIn early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance.\n\nIce T\n\nAn odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality.\n\nBut Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I did not pick up and blocked the number.\n\nCeline Dion\n\nAccording to reports, Celine Dion did not decline Trump because she did not want to perform, but more because she was just too busy.\n\nDion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (## January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans.\n\nJohn Legend\n\nJohn Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate.\n\nWe tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that is preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\n\nAdam Lambert\n\nAdam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues.\n\nI do not think I would take money on that one, he told the BBC. I do not think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks\n\nOpposition to the Iraq War derailed the career of Texan threesome Dixie Chicks (Getty)\n\nSpeaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now, he said."

The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing Wolf\u2019s show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.\n\nThe ##-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda \u2014 unless, of course, it\u2019s funny. \u201cYou can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn\u2019t do on TV,\u201d Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix\u2019s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: we are thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.\n\nThe announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (I want equal pay! And a chardonnay) to dating and other social issues.\n\nThough Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his #### stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony.\n\nBy jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central \u2014 and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable network\u2019s Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network.\n\nLooking ahead, Wolf's Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The President\u2019s Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.\n\nWolf is repped by UTA, Dixon Talent and Hansen Jacobson; Powell is with UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero and Hansen Jacobson; and Nangle is repped by UTA and Jackoway Tyerman."

They would remain in contact for the next ## months where they frequently met and exchanged emails.\n\nHere is the infamous article via Yahoo News:\n\n\u201cU.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials \u2014 including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.\n\nThe activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and \u201chigh ranking sanctioned individuals\u201d in Moscow over the summer as evidence of \u201csignificant and disturbing ties\u201d between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.\n\nSome of those briefed were \u201ctaken aback\u201d when they learned about Page\u2019s contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the adviser\u2019s talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being \u201cactively monitored and investigated.\u201d\n\nA senior U.S. law enforcement official did not dispute that characterization when asked for comment by Yahoo News. \u201cIt\u2019s on our radar screen,\u201d said the official about Page\u2019s contacts with Russian officials. \u201cIt\u2019s being looked at.\u201d\n\nPage is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, located around the corner from Trump Tower, that specializes in oil and gas deals in Russia and other Central Asian countries. He declined repeated requests to comment for this story.\n\nTrump first mentioned Page\u2019s name when asked to identify his \u201cforeign policy team\u201d during an interview with the Washington Post editorial team last March. Describing him then only as a \u201cPhD,\u201d Trump named Page as among five advisers \u201cthat we are dealing with.\u201d But his precise role in the campaign remains unclear; Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks last month called him an \u201cinformal foreign adviser\u201d who \u201cdoes not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.\u201d Asked this week by Yahoo News, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Page \u201chas no role\u201d and added: \u201cWe are not aware of any of his activities, past or present.\u201d Miller did not respond when asked why Trump had previously described Page as one of his advisers.\n\nThe questions about Page come amid mounting concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about Russian cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and state election databases in Arizona and Illinois. In a rare public talk this week, former undersecretary of defense for intelligence Mike Vickers said that the Russian cyberattacks constituted meddling in the U.S. election and were \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d Also, this week, two senior Democrats \u2014 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 released a joint statement that went further then what U.S. officials had publicly said about the matter.\n\n\u201cBased on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,\u201d they said. \u201cAt the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.\u201d They added that \u201corders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government.\u201d\n\nPage came to the attention of officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow several years ago when he showed up in the Russian capital during several business trips and made provocative public comments critical of U.S. policy and sympathetic to Putin. \u201cHe was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did,\u201d said one U.S. official who served in Russia at the time.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been shy about expressing those views in the U.S. as well. Last March, shorty after he was named by Trump as one of his advisers, Page told Bloomberg News he had been an adviser to, and investor in, Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company. He then blamed Obama administration sanctions \u2014 imposed as a response to the Russian annexation of Crimea \u2014 for driving down the company\u2019s stock. \u201cSo many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy,\u201d Page said in the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.\u201d\n\nPage showed up again in Moscow in early July, just two weeks before the Republican National Convention formally nominated Trump for president, and once again criticized U.S. policy. Speaking at a commencement address for the New Economic School, an institution funded in part by major Russian oligarchs close to Putin, Page asserted that \u201cWashington and other West capitals\u201d had impeded progress in Russia \u201cthrough their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Page declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip, according to a Reuters report.\n\nBut U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian\u2019s leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August #### named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia\u2019s \u201cillegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine.\u201d (The Treasury announcement described Sechin as \u201cutterly loyal to Vladimir Putin \u2014 a key component to his current standing.\u201d At their alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page, the Western intelligence source said.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow \u2014 Igor Diveykin. A former Russian security official, Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election, the Western intelligence source said.\u201d\n\nH/T ###Percent FedUp\n\nRelated"

They could never have known that a drunk ##-year-old, Mar\n\nin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.\n\nPolice reports revealed that Heidgen\u2019s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least ## drinks and had been driving at ## miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.\n\nThe driver of the limousine, ##-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride\u2019s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.\n\nDespite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.\n\nThen, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness \u2013 her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.\n\nOne of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride\u2019s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:\n\n\u201cI was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t go back there. It\u2019s bad,\u2019\u201d Michael Tangney said. \u201cI opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.\u201d\n\nBut, tragically, the worst was yet to come.\n\nMichael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter\u2019s head in her hands. Katie\u2019s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.\n\nFor the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie\u2019s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.\n\nEventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter\u2019s face one last time.\n\nThe event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to ## years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder \u2013 though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer\u2019s daughter.\n\nJennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.\n\n\u201cSince no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,\u201d Jennifer said.\n\n\u201cI hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.\u201d\n\nThe fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen your fair share of stories on the news and watched it happen in movies. Some people, unfortunately, have even had to experience it first-hand, just like Jennifer and her family.\n\nPlease share this story to remind any and all that alcohol and driving are a combination that never belong together. Hopefully, by doing so, we can prevent acts like tragedy occurring in the future."

Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent\u2019s struggle with migration.\n\nBavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in #### and ####, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:\n\nCompromise\n\nThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.\n\nMerkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.\n\nNo Compromise\n\nIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That\u2019s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel\u2019s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it\u2019s hard to see how the coalition continues.\n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t come to that and Merkel is given until the June ##-## EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.\n\nConfidence vote\n\nFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined ### seats, and the SPD with ###, have a majority of ## seats in the ###-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party\u2019s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have ## seats.\n\nGermany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It\u2019s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. ## attacks. He used it again in #### amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.\n\nMerkel resigns\n\nShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany\u2019s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.\n\nSplit on the right\n\nThe CDU and the CSU are sister parties, with a joint parliamentary caucus and electoral program. Think of the CSU as the center-right\u2019s Bavarian chapter \u2014 the CDU operates in all of Germany\u2019s ## states except Bavaria.\n\nSo a breach would be drastic, but not unprecedented. In ####, CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauss called off the joint caucus, but the split was short-lived. For the Bavarians, going it alone would theoretically open a path for the CDU to campaign in Bavaria, weakening the CSU\u2019s position.\n\nA hoax tweet that rattled markets on Friday raised exactly that possibility. It presented a fake quote from the CDU state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, as saying his party should prepare to set up a Bavarian chapter for the next national election. Merkel\u2019s chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, quickly stepped in to say the report was invented. \u201cWe should all remain calm,\u201d he said."

Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.\n\nNY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government\u2019s handling of migrants.\n\n\u201cIt is intolerable that human trafficking \u2014 modern-day slavery \u2014 could occur in our own backyard,\u201d Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. \u201cBut what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.\u201d\n\nAs detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed.

She gathered up her stuff and left, together with the rest of her celebration.\n\nVice noted:\n\nBut despite all the backlash she\u2019s gotten from the right, Stephanie Wilkinson says she does not regret a thing.\n\n\u201cWe simply felt there are moments in time when folks need to live their own convictions. This appeared to be one.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders came to the Red Hen along with her husband along with six other people on Friday night, the boxer called Wilkinson to mention the team was\u201da little concerned,\u201d Wilkinson told the Post.\n\nShe headed to the restaurant, and\u2013while Sanders and her friends munched on cheeseboards\u2013called the team to a huddle in the kitchen, and asked if they wanted Sanders to leave. According to the Article, a handful of her workers are gay, and many others are revulsed by Sanders\u2019 treatment of this emergency at the boundary. They wanted her gone.\n\nWilkinson took Sanders out into the patio and asked her to leave, telling her why the restaurant had\u201dcertain criteria\u201d like\u201dhonesty, and compassion, and collaboration,\u201d Wilkinson told the Post. Sanders agreed to proceed, gathered up her things, and headed out, followed by the remainder of her party, whose meal Wilkinson comped.\n\nFollowing the White House Press Secretary identified the place by name on Twitter, President Trump called it\u201dfilthy,\u201d and a army of his assistants got busy screwing with its business\u2013beginning a campaign to make a bunch of bogus dinner reservations and tanking its score on Yelp.\n\nI always had a guideline, if a restaurant is filthy on the outside, it\u2019s dirty on the inside!\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s Yelp page has been bombarded with over ##,### one-star reviews, leaving it in a sound one-and-a-half.\n\nPiggybacking on Trump\u2019s dig on the area being\u201dfilthy,\u201d several pissed-off reviewers have claimed to have discovered roaches in their food because Sanders was kicked out, but some have compared Wilkinson to a Nazi and called her and her staff\u201dun-American hateful bigots.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve a company, and I want the company to flourish. This feels just like the moment in our democracy when people need to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to maintain their morals.\u201d\n\nSaturday afternoon the Press Secretary hadn\u2019t any difficulty in telling her story and actually named the establishment on Twitter, which was followed by President Trump calling it\u201dfilthy\u201d on his Twitter page.\n\nWhich in turn led to a military people deplorables wasting no time whatsoever in creating our feelings heard on social networking, on Yelp and by creating fake dinner reservations in demonstration. The Restaurant\u2019s Yelp page currently has the company at one star and a half.\n\nWhile on the other side, liberals were pleased to leave this slum a #-star rating although they threw a hissy fit every time a Christian baker didn\u2019t need to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding a few years back.\n\nWilkerson went on to confirm to the Article she feels like this is the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable decisions and actions to maintain their morals.\n\nOdd which she\u2019d cite morals as it pertains in the side that amuses a sexual predator such as Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary who dragged his accusers through the mud in order to conserve her own political ambitions.\n\nFeatured Image Source H/T: RWNOfficial"

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Normally, on Sundays, we take a reflective look at the past week and set the agenda for the coming days, but today is no normal Sunday. We are four hours away from a showdown in the House of Representatives, a series of votes that will determine the future of health care reform, impact the economy, influence this November's election and set the stage for the rest of President Obama's agenda. Today is no normal Sunday. Today is game day. I am Candy Crowley and this is State of the Union.\n\n\n\nThis morning, health reform from all angles. Two House leaders, John Larson and Mike Pence, on today's vote. Two senior senators, Dianne Feinstein, and Orrin Hatch, on the week ahead. And analysis from Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett.\n\n\n\nWe have heard the words end game so many times in this health care debate, I would not try it now. That said, it would in fact be the end if Republicans prevailed in today's vote. For Democrats, the magic number is ###. that is how many yeas needed to pass the health care bill in the House, ### votes among the ### Democratic members. It has been a struggle all week to get there. We begin with seven days in two minutes.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nDAVID AXELROD, SR. ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT: I think we will have the votes.\n\n\n\nREP. JOHN A. BOEHNER, R-OHIO: If she had ### votes, this bill would be long gone.\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Hello, Ohio!\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: When we bring the bill to the floor, we will have the votes.\n\n\n\nREP. JAMES E. CLYBURN, D-S.C., MAJORITY WHIP: We need to get to ###.

And I think he looks forward to it. REP. ERIC CANTOR, R-VA.: I mean, it is clear. They do not have the votes, because the American people cannot stand this bill.\n\n\n\nREP. DENNIS J.

It is in your hands.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Here to look ahead to today's vote and the high stakes politics surrounding it, House Democratic Caucus Chairman, John Larson of Connecticut, and the House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana. Gentlemen, thank you both for joining me.\n\n\n\nPENCE: Thank you, Candy.\n\n\n\nLARSON: Great to be with you, Candy.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: State of play, where are you? ###, do you have it locked in?\n\n\n\nLARSON: This is a historic day.

We are so proud of the Democratic caucus, that we will be a part of history, joining Franklin Delano Roosevelt's passage of Social Security, Lyndon Johnson's passage of Medicare, and now Barack Obama's passage of health care reform.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: So you have got the ###?\n\n\n\nLARSON: we have got the votes. And the reason for that, Candy, I think it started earlier this week with Natoma Canfield becoming the poster child for -- or lady for health care reform. And that struck such a cord within our caucus. And Dennis Moore standing up to give a speech in the caucus was Blackberried by a woman who works with him in Kansas.

What is left for Republicans to do? Congressman Larson says they have the ###. So it is all over but the shouting? You guys vote no and move on?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Well, I do not know if they have the votes. House Republicans are going to use every means at our disposal.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: What is that?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Well, stay tuned, Candy. It's going to be an interesting day.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Can you disrupt the vote? I mean, what is available?\n\n\n\nPENCE: We are going to use every means at our disposal to oppose this government takeover of health care. Because quite frankly, as thousands gather at rallies all across this country and here in the nation's capital, yesterday, you know, the American people are sick and tired of runaway federal spending by both parties, of borrowing and bailouts and takeovers. And I believe this is going to be a historic weekend.\n\n\n\nLARSON: It is.\n\n\n\nPENCE: But I think it is going to be different from the way John thinks it is going to be. I think this is going to be a historic weekend because I think this weekend is going to be the beginning of the end of business as usual in Washington, D.C. I think the American people see an administration and see a Congress that are in a headlong rush to confront the very real challenges that we have in health care with more government instead of more freedom.\n\n\n\nThey know -- the Republicans have been offering solutions from the beginning. Let people purchase health insurance across state lines, pass malpractice reform, cover preexisting conditions. All of that can be done without a massive, trillion-dollar expansion of the federal government and burdening future generations with more deficits and more debt.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: But the reality of this day is that you do not have the votes to stop it. You may have the means to delay it. PENCE: Right. You know, the Republicans, it should not be a news flash to anybody, Republicans do not have the votes to stop anything in the House of Representatives. We are in a decisive minority.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: (inaudible) politically.\n\n\n\nPENCE: But what is remarkable about this one-year debate has proven my point, that a minority in Congress plus the American people equals a majority. Republicans -- the reason they were not able to do this last year -- remember all the deadlines? We had deadlines in the summer, we had deadlines in the fall, we had deadlines at the end of the year. The American people do not want this government takeover of health care. And I do not know if they have the votes today, but I guarantee you, the American people know they have the votes in America.\n\n\n\nLARSON: The American people who are already on Medicare, all of our veterans who already receive Tricare, understand the importance and the value of having insurance coverage. For ## million Americans who have none, ## million will now be able to have access to insurance, lowering costs, lowering costs for small businesses, lowering the national debt. First, $### billion, and then $#.# trillion. We cannot afford not to do this. And taking care of those people--\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: I want to talk about the debt. Hang on one second. I have got to take a small break--\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: We will come back. I do want to talk about the costs. There are some figures out there floating. i will do that, we will be back with Congressmen Larson and Pence right after this.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: We are back with Democratic Congressman John Larson of Connecticut and Republican Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana. We were talking about the cost of this. The CBO has said over ## years this health care bill will reduce the deficit by $### billion.\n\n\n\nHowever, that does not include what might come and what has been promised, with more than a wink and a nod to doctors, which is to up their Medicare payments, their reimbursements, which would cost $### million, which then means it actually would be -- would add to the deficit.\n\n\n\nIs that -- is my math correct there? LARSON: Well, if that were to be true. But here is the thing, there is no question about the fact that we need to take care of the docs and we need to emphasize primary care. But also what never gets discussed, Candy, is something that Reuters came out with earlier this year, $### billion annually in inefficiencies in this system, lack of interoperability in hospitals, lack of a continuum of care, and fraud and abuse -- $### billion.\n\n\n\nI think that we are going to -- that is $# trillion over a ##-year period. I think that we are more than going to be able to wring out the cost in there. I think that is why the president brought people down to Washington, to the White House, that is why he brought the six (ph) in to try to wring out those costs as we go forward.\n\n\n\nYou know, we spend ## percent of gross domestic product. The closest country to us is Switzerland. I cannot believe that we cannot get that money out of there.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: cannot we get that money out of there?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Yes, yes, we do such a great job here in Washington wringing out the cost.\n\n\n\nLARSON: Now that is in the private sector.\n\n\n\nPENCE: One-point-six trillion dollar deficit this year, you know, only in Washington D.C. could you say with a straight face that you are going to spend $# trillion and save tax-payers money. Look, you point out the doc fix. This is a total fraud. The Democrats are leaving out $### billion in spending that the speaker of the house committed again this week to spend, which makes this -- even using this CBO's numbers, it makes it a bill that adds to the deficit in the short term and in the long term.\n\n\n\nBut look, even beyond that, Candy, the American people know that you expand the federal government's role in health care without giving the American people more health care choices by purchasing across state lines, without passing any medical malpractice reform at all -- roughly a third of health care costs in this country I hear are actually defensive medicine driven by junk lawsuits.\n\n\n\nThe American people know this is going to cost more and add more to the deficit, add more to the debt, cost higher taxes even than the rosiest scenarios that are presented...\n\n\n\nLARSON: The CBO is the bible. The CBO says...\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: It is, but it's not always accurate, as you know.\n\n\n\nLARSON: We have arguments with them all of the time, but...\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Somebody once told me that predicting...\n\n\n\nLARSON: ... that is all that we can -- that is all that we can vote on.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Sure, absolutely. But it still is one of those things that we might not find out...\n\n\n\nPENCE: And the president...\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: ... except for ## years from now.\n\n\n\nLARSON: And the president has put in numerous reforms that are going to take effect, including the inability to rescind your insurance policy, pre-existing conditions. For women across this country, Candy, I mean, there birth is a pre-existing condition, domestic violence is a pre-existing condition, a C-section is a pre- existing condition, in-vitro fertilization, come on.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nPENCE: My wife had to -- John, my wife had a pre-existing condition. I lost my job about ## years ago. My wife had a pre- existing condition. She was pregnant with our daughter Audrey. We went to the state guarantee fund, a fund that would be replenished if we passed medical malpractice reform, we could use the savings to strengthen those funds to cover people like my wife was covered.\n\n\n\nYou do not need a government takeover of health care. You do not need to mandate that every American purchase health insurance whether they want it or need it or not, and you do not need to put us on a pathway towards socialized medicine.\n\n\n\nLARSON: Where is the takeover by the government?\n\n\n\nPENCE: And that is what this crowd is doing today.\n\n\n\nLARSON: Where is the takeover by the government? CROWLEY: Let me ask you something, just turn...\n\n\n\nLARSON: Humana runs Medicare currently. Tricare is run by them. Where is the takeover of government?\n\n\n\nPENCE: Well, i will break it down. John, if you mandate that every American purchase health insurance, you mandate that every business provide it...\n\n\n\nLARSON: Do we mandate that people get car insurance?\n\n\n\nPENCE: ... you create a...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nPENCE: ... so that people end up in government-run insurance, and you provide public funding for abortion, you mandate insurance plans, cover it within the exchange...\n\n\n\nLARSON: There is no funding for abortion in this bill.\n\n\n\nPENCE: It is a government takeover of health care.\n\n\n\nLARSON: There is no funding for abortion in this bill. It follows Hyde. that is not -- that is the case. PENCE: John, you know that is not true. The Catholic Church...\n\n\n\nLARSON: I know it's absolutely true.\n\n\n\nPENCE: ... the Catholic bishops, the right to life says...\n\n\n\nLARSON: Sixty thousand nuns cannot be wrong.\n\n\n\nPENCE: ... public funding for abortions is in this bill.\n\n\n\nLARSON: Thank God for the sisters of Notre Dame, that is what I think.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Let me call a time here, because we are out of time. But for more of this, our audience can tune into the House debate starting this afternoon. And I suspect that pass or not pass, this debate continues as we watch how it goes.\n\n\n\nLARSON: that is right. Very strong disagreements. But Mike Pence is an honorable man. And I look forward to this debate, and as are our colleagues. I hope that we do ratchet down the conversation though, because when two of our colleagues are spat on and hurled racial slurs, it is time...\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: It did indeed happen.\n\n\n\nLARSON: ... it's time to ratchet down things a little bit.\n\n\n\nPENCE: Well, i will tell you, I was in Selma with John Lewis, if what is reported to have happened was reported is contemptible, I denounce it in the strongest terms. But I assure you, this debate will not end today.\n\n\n\nLARSON: I agree with that.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Or probably on this show.\n\n\n\nLARSON: I agree with that.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.\n\n\n\nLARSON: There is going to be a lot of work to go to...\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: If health care reform wins passage in the House today, the measure heads back to the Senate. Up next, a quick tutorial on what happens next. And then a conversation with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: A quick reality check for those who today's House votes will bring us to the finish line, not quite, not yet. If House Democrats muster the votes today, two things happen. First the Senate version of health care reform will be passed by the House and will then be ready for the president to sign into law. Second, House Democrats will pass a fix-it bill, a companion measure of sorts to correct the things they do not like about the Senate measure. That bill has to go to the Senate. If the Senate goes the easy route, they will pass the fixes without change and send it off to the president. But if the Senate changes anything, if it adds or subtracts from the House measure, it must go back to the House for another vote before it goes to the president.\n\n\n\nSenate Republicans have some options which could delay or change the bill, including parliamentary challenges to any part of it as unrelated to the budget. Why did not the Schoolhouse Rock teach us about this? We will do our best to get answers on what comes next from senators Orrin Hatch and Dianne Feinstein right after the break.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: As we explained, even if the health care reform bill wins passage in the House later today, it still has another legislative hurdle to clear, back to the Senate for those changes or fixes, if you will, that House Democrats want.\n\n\n\nJoining us, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.\n\n\n\nSo the other day I noticed, Senator Hatch, that you said it would be nuts for anyone to believe that this is the House's last word on this. You think the Senate will change the fix-it bill that is coming over to you?\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, if the rules are followed, they'd have to. Because there is a Social Security component. And you cannot do that on reconciliation. there is also an appropriations component as well.\n\n\n\nSo if -- if the parliamentarian upholds that and Joe Biden does not overrule the parliamentarian, which would be a first, then it seems to me that it's going to have to be sent back to the House. So anybody that thinks that this is only going to be a one-time deal today in the House, I think, is grossly mistaken.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Senator Feinstein, do you think it's possible for the Senate to take that bill and just go, OK, fine with us?\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Yes, I do. And I think that is exactly what we will do. And I really disagree with my friend and colleague. I believe there are at least ## votes there. I think the bill has been carefully vetted with the parliamentarian. I believe he will stand for each part of it.\n\n\n\nAnd the bill that the House passes today goes to the president. He signs it. Then the reconciliation bill comes over to us. we will probably begin debate on Tuesday. It will be posted -- it takes some time -- begin debate on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nNow, i am sure what Senator Hatch's party will do is submit a whole host of amendments. we will have a major vote-a-thon. And this will go on for several days. And I believe, at the end, more than ## Democrats will hold firm and will pass the reconciliation bill and we will have health care reform. I can say, for my state, the reconciliation bill is very important. Because we have now # million people without any insurance in California. The number has gone up # million people a year for the last two years. So this bill is necessary.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Senator Hatch, I want to ask you about the vote-a-thon, but I first want to play something Senator Reid said recently.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: we are in the last minute of play. The shot clock is turned off. The other side knows what the outcome will be. So they are trying to foul us and foul us and foul us and foul us again, just to keep the clock from reading zero. they are not just delaying the inevitable; they are delaying the imperative.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Are you going on after -- after the shot clock has...\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nI mean, you know, Senator Feinstein calls it a vote-a-thon. I mean, is this the Republican approach to this now, is just to delay the inevitable?\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, not really. I think it's to try and get amendments passed that really are valid amendments. I think, if you have a Social Security component in it, it has -- it has to come back to the House. And a parliamentarian has to rule the right way.\n\n\n\nBut who knows? I do not know what the parliamentarian is going to do. All I can say is this. You know, as I walk around this country, and i have been all over the country, people come up to me from everywhere, Democrats, Republicans, saying, we cannot afford this; we cannot do this. We do not even have solid, final scoring on this.\n\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, the actuary at CMS said he cannot get the final scoring. They also do not include the doc fix in it, which is $### billion, and that is at present worth. And that does not even take care of Medicaid.\n\n\n\nOf the ## million people you are going to cover, ## million are pushed into Medicaid.\n\n\n\nI mean, let me just tell you, we are coming to a Europeanization of America. And the American people sense it. They feel it. They know that we cannot afford this.\n\n\n\nAnd, frankly, the doc fix that they have on Medicaid...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK) HATCH: He's a letter -- here's a letter from my governor saying -- now, for two years, they say they'll hold the states free. But then you go off the clip because they cannot afford to pay for it in the federal government.\n\n\n\nAnd -- and Medicaid, they are paying -- the doctors are getting ## percent of what the private sector pays doctors. And they are up in arms. they are not going to take patients now. You can imagine how bad this is going to be if this bill goes through.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Senator Feinstein, do you worry about either unintended consequences or changes in the economy that could, in the end, if this is made into law, really ruin some aspects of health care?\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, of course. This is not the perfect bill. We all know that.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, that is for sure.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: We all know that there are going to have to be fixes down the road, just as every major program has had; Medicare has had; Social Security will likely have because of the explosion of costs.\n\n\n\nHaving said that, you have to look at the basics. And the basics are that we pay far more than European nations do for health care. And they have a much better performance.\n\n\n\nwe are about ## percent; France is ## percent. And in overall performance by the World Health Organization, France is ranked number one. I think we are ranked ##.\n\n\n\nWe spend a lot of money, but we do not necessarily spend it in the right way or the right places.\n\n\n\nNow, let me just finish. This bill is really important. Because, if we do not pass it now, you can forget health care reform forever after, I believe. So this is the opportunity. we are right at the goal line. I believe it's going to pass the House. It will be signed by the president. We should pass a reconciliation bill.\n\n\n\nAnd I would really appeal to my good friend, Senator Hatch. Let this reconciliation bill get passed. Then, you can see. If it's wrong, you will certainly say so. If it works, hopefully, you will say so as well.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: And we will get your answer right after this, because i have got to take a break. And we will find out if you listened to her appeal, right after this.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: We are back with two top senators, Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Orrin Hatch.\n\n\n\nWhen last we met, she was asking if you would just let this reconciliation bill go through and see what happens. FEINSTEIN: Suggesting.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, let me tell you, Republicans are dedicated against this bill. We consider it an awful bill.\n\n\n\nDo you realize they are going to subsidize families that make over -- families of four that make over $##,### a year?\n\n\n\nI mean, we are getting to where ## percent of the people in this country are going to depend on subsidies. And, of course, I know Dianne cannot agree with that or does not believe in that.\n\n\n\nBut -- and all I can say is -- is, everywhere I go, people say, how do we pay for this? You know, in all honesty, they have jacked up the costs of Medicare. they are going to take better than $### billion, now, out of Medicare. they are going to increase taxes by over $### billion. they are going to sock it to individuals who do not -- who cannot afford to buy insurance. they are going to have to pay #.# percent of their gross income.\n\n\n\nBusinesses are now going to have to pay up to $#,### per employee if they do not provide health insurance.\n\n\n\nYou reach a point where you say, who is going to pay for all of this? And it's going to come down to us taxpayers. And like I say, it's the Europeanization of America, and that is the worst thing that could possibly happen to our country.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: You -- you said earlier that, of course, there were things that worried you about the bill. If you looked at in the totality, what worries you the most?\n\n\n\nIs there anything that he says that you think, you know, yes, that is a worry of mine?\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, there -- the bill is a combination of a number of different things designed to cover more people. The bill has very big strong points. For example, right away, there is a $# billion fund for people with pre-existing conditions who cannot get health insurance today.\n\n\n\nHATCH: we are both for that. we are both for that.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: that is a very positive thing.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Sure.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: So the bill, when really accumulated, the Congressional Budget Office says, will save, over ## years, $### billion.\n\n\n\nNow, Orrin will say, well, it's not this; it's not that; it's not the other thing. But that is the fact that we go on when we assess a bill. CROWLEY: But is not also true, Senator...\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: So over ## years, this bill, i am confident, will not cost more.\n\n\n\nNow, as I said, are there certain parts that may have to be tweaked, that do not work exactly right? But he has given a litany of complaints about the bill. The thrust of the bill is to provide more people with coverage.\n\n\n\nOne of the good things the bill does is it reduces the nonpremium costs for those ## percent of people that have medical health insurance. It reduces it from ## percent to ## percent so that more money from insurance companies will actually go for medical care. And I think that is important.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Politically, is not it going to be hard to argue, should this bill pass, and we think it will, just given the numbers, to say, listen, people are now going to be -- not be thrown off their insurance because they got sick. There will be no more caps.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Exactly.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: There will be help for people down the road, to help subsidize it. How can you argue against that? is not that a pretty political powerful package?\n\n\n\nHATCH: Well, i am not arguing -- i am not arguing against that. I think Republicans certainly -- we could agree on a large percentage of things together. But there was really no effort to get us involved.\n\n\n\nAll I can say is this, is that everywhere I go -- and i have said it over and over -- people say, how are you going to pay for this? How do you pay for it?\n\n\n\nNow, the CMS actuary -- that is the actuary for the administration -- says the cost curve will not be bent, that premiums are going to go up. I have to say that I believe that -- that CBO -- of course they have to decide these budgetary matters based upon the papers given them by the House of Representatives and by the Senate, and those papers are stacked in favor of trying to live within our means, but they do not.\n\n\n\nThe fact is that they double-count in this bill. They have all kinds of other gimmicks in this bill that try to get this bill down to -- everybody knows that this, extrapolated over ## years, is going to be $#.# trillion more on top of what we are already spending, $#.# trillion.\n\n\n\nYou cannot tell me that this country can afford to do that and that we cannot find a way, by working together, to really come up with a health care system that will work and work within financial means.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: i am going to give you the last short word. And that is, are you comfortable with the cost of this bill...\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Yes.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: ... and comfortable the country can afford it?\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Yes. I believe we can. And I believe that will be sorted out over time.\n\n\n\nI think there is one thing that is not in the bill, that the president was good enough to take my bill, which would give the secretary of health and human services some control over the rate of premiums to ensure that they are reasonable for people who have private-sector insurance. Unfortunately, the parliamentarian said that could not be added to the reconciliation bill. I have introduced it as a separate bill.\n\n\n\nI believe this is a huge problem out there. You have Anthem in California and ###,### policies just jacking up premiums up to ## percent in California and then saying there may be another increase in the middle of the year.\n\n\n\nAnd so people are being pushed off of their health insurance because of the cost of premiums. And this is one thing we need to strengthen, in my view, and hopefully will as a separate piece of legislation.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Orrin Hatch, I cannot thank you both enough for coming. I appreciate it.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you.\n\n\n\nHATCH: Thank you.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: More of this on the Senate floor next week...\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Oh, you bet.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: ... we promise. (LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Thank you.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Up next, in our American Dispatch, why, despite the claims of some politicians, it's hard to say exactly how most Americans feel about the health reform bill. And then Donna Brazile and Ben Bennett on the potential fallout for both Democratic and Republican lawmakers up for re-election this fall.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Our American Dispatch looks at a central question. What do Americans think?\n\n\n\nHouse Republican Leader John Boehner answers for Republicans.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBOEHNER: Because the American people are saying Stop, and they are screaming at the top of their lungs. (END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: But are they? Two polls released this week leave lots of room for debate. A Pew poll released Thursday asks, Do you favor or oppose the current bill?\n\n\n\nOnly ## percent said they favor it. So is Minority Leader Boehner right?\n\n\n\nA Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asks, Is it better to pass the Obama plan or keep the current system?\n\n\n\nThe respondents were split right down the middle.\n\n\n\nIs it in the way the question is asked? Are more people more likely to support it when it's called the Obama plan or is it that people think some change is better than no change?\n\n\n\nYou be the judge. We will sort through the complicated politics of all this with Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett after a short break.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Joining me here in Washington, two of my favorite people, CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and CNN political contributor and host of Morning in America, Bill Bennett, who is also author of the new book A Century Turns. These authors and stuff, OK.\n\n\n\nThe politics of all this. John Larson, head of the Democratic caucus, says they have got the ###, done deal, goes over to the Senate, Dianne Feinstein all confident they are going to pass it. It's going to be law. How does this all play out politically? I want to play you something the -- two things, actually, the president said yesterday. First, there was this.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: I am actually confident -- i have talked to some of you individually -- that it will end up being the smart thing to do politically, because I believe that good policy is good politics.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: OK, now, about two minutes later, he had this to say.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Now, I cannot guarantee that this is good politics. Every one of you know your districts better than I do.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: So, let's see, i am thinking we are not really sure how the politics are going to play out. What do you think? BENNETT: Yes, well, as a former teacher of logic, he did not contradict himself, because he said I believe this will be good politics because it's good policy, but I cannot guarantee it. OK, we have heard that before.\n\n\n\nI think it's bad politics, because I think it's bad policy, and not just from a partisan point of view, but let me just do it analytically. You would not have so many nervous Democrats if this looked like it was really good politics. I do not think it is.\n\n\n\nAnd, again, I think, when we see how this plays out, one play will be in November with the midterm elections. Another play, we will see what happens with budget issues.\n\n\n\nAnd since misrepresentations are all over the place in this -- in this proposal, and you look at a state like Massachusetts, which is a state closest to what this federal program is, I think they are going to regret it. Be careful what you wish for, Richard Butler (ph) said, because you may get it.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: You know, Donna, what the White House is counting on -- what Democrats are counting on is that, after this is signed into law, people will go, Oh, you mean I will not be thrown my -- that there will be things in there, and their argument has always been, Well, they do not really know what it's in this bill. Is that going to work?\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Well, it's true, Candy, that only ## percent of voters understand what is inside the bill because we have been talking about the pie crust and not what is in the filling. And I think as soon as they understand that children with pre-existing conditions will not be kicked off their policies, small businesses will have access to an exchange that will help lower their costs and provide better coverage for their employees, I think as soon as they learn the details of this proposal, they will become very comfortable with it.\n\n\n\nAnd we all know that the -- that the price that the American people will pay if Congress fails to act is that their premiums will continue to rise $##,### over the next ## years. This is good policy, is good politics, it's good for the American people, it's good for the economy. there is no reason for Democrats to run away from this bill.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: So you do not think that the Democrats are going to lose seats this November because of the health care bill?\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Democrats will lose seats, Republicans will lose seats simply because there are open seats that will no longer go into the Democratic column. They will lose seats...\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: But not because of health care?\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Well, health care, Candy -- and some Democrats might lose because the voters are simply tired of that Democrat and may be tired of Republicans, too. I do not think we should judge this bill based on who will win and who will lose if we are doing what is right for the American people, we are doing what is right for taxpayers. This is a good approach to trying to solve a very longstanding problem in this country.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: And that is how the president sold it, right? It was like, do not...\n\n\n\nBENNETT: Sure.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: ... do not do this on politics. Do this because it's the right thing to do.\n\n\n\nBENNETT: Look, that is fine. Pericles says courage is the secret of democracy. The president has said something like that, too, do the courageous thing. I think some members of Congress, some Democrats have heard that as, Do what my conscience tells me, people like Bart Stupak, so we shall -- we shall see.\n\n\n\nBut hold the tape, this tape. Not to be mean, but Democrats will lose seats on this. They will lose a lot of seats. Again, this is what the nervousness is about.\n\n\n\nNow, if this turns out to surprise me and surprise a lot of people and be profoundly good policy, save the tape for that, too, because I will say to so. But look what happened in Massachusetts. You only had # percent uninsured. This thing opened the floodgates. What happens when you nationalize this kind of issue? You have states like Texas and California with ## percent and ## percent uninsured. This could bust the budget and really hurt the country.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Well, you know, what is disingenuous about the arguments that the opponents of health care reform will constantly give is that they are worried about the deficit, they are worried about the deficit. Well, if we do nothing, health care will...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: ... consume about ## percent to ## percent of our GDP. If we do nothing, individuals like myself and others who have individual policies will see their premiums continue to rise.\n\n\n\nIf the Republicans would like to somehow or another defend ## percent increase in health care costs, children getting kicked off their policies simply because they have asthma, let them go out and defend that. Democrats will defend the substance of this and let the politics play out, you know, in November.\n\n\n\nBENNETT: Obamacare and doing nothing are not the only options. There are lots of other plans and lots of other ideas fully fleshed out, as Paul Ryan's plan that he wrote with Tom Coburn. This is a plan that never got to see the light of day, never allowed a scoring by CBO. We may revisit it again in the future when we see what this one wreaks.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Is this -- is health care the election issue, or is it really the economy?\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: It's the economy. It's the economy. It's jobs. It's people feeling secure about their own livelihood. It's the American dream that is at stake. And, look, Paul Ryan had a plan that covered # million Americans, reduced the deficit by $## billion. This is a plan that will cover ## million additional Americans and reduce the deficit over $### billion in the next ## years and, of course, $#.# trillion over the next ## years.\n\n\n\nIf this -- this is good policy. Republicans who are concerned about the deficit, like Democrats and independents, should get behind this bill.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Bottom line, Ryan will not pass. Is it...\n\n\n\nBENNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: So it will be this. But is this the election-year issue or is it jobs?\n\n\n\nBENNETT: It's a big part of it, and jobs is a big part of it, but there is a larger thing, too, which is Washington and distrust of government. And who do they think they are? And do not they know, cannot they read that a majority of us said we were opposed to this, we really do not like this?\n\n\n\nAnd when the costs start coming in -- and, by the way, when they count the doctor fix, which is going to put this in deficit, they will see it's more cost to the government, more cost to the taxpayer, higher taxes. It's going to cost the Democrats. It's bad policy, bad politics.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Let me -- let me quote -- let me -- let me quote Janet Jackson.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Make it a short quote.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: What have you done for me lately? you have done nothing on jobs. you have done nothing on health care. you have done nothing to help fix this economy. The American people like to vote for something, not just against something.\n\n\n\nBENNETT: Well, they'll have the chance. They'll have the chance. And you will have your way, and the Democrats will rule on this, and probably get it, and then they will own the store.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Well, we are going to still love you, though.\n\n\n\nBENNETT: Well, I hope so.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: The love-fest will continue. And they will be back, I promise you.\n\n\n\nBENNETT: we will still be your favorites? we will still be your favorites?\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Still my favorites, I promise.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Thank you.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Ahead, my colleague and former State of the Union host John King is back here for a Sunday chat about his new show.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Let's check some of the stories breaking this Sunday.\n\n\n\nCongressman John Larson said earlier on this program that Democrats have the ### votes necessary to pass health care reform in the House of Representatives. The vote is scheduled for later this afternoon. Republican Congressman Mike Pence said that his party will use every means at their disposal to oppose the measure.\n\n\n\nIt is a weekend of protests here in Washington. Opponents of the health care reform bill gathered outside the U.S. Capitol Saturday demanding that lawmakers kill the bill.\n\n\n\nAlso yesterday, hundreds held a demonstration to mark the seventh anniversary of the Iraq war.\n\n\n\nAnd today, as the House votes on health care reform, thousands are expected to gather here in the nation's capital to call on President Obama and Congress to take up immigration reform.\n\n\n\nNorth Dakota's Red River is expected to crest today. Several hundred thousand sandbags have been placed along the river's banks to keep the water at bay. So far, flooding has not been as bad as feared.\n\n\n\nTwo weeks after parliamentary elections in Iraq, the vote remains too close to call. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki wants a manual recount. He says he's asking for it to preserve the integrity of the electoral process. So far, preliminary results show the prime minister's coalition is leading in seven of Iraq's ## provinces.\n\n\n\nAnd Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his government will not stop building more Jewish settlements in disputed East Jerusalem. Announcement of the move during a recent visit to Israel by Vice President Joe Biden has called a strain in U.S.-Israeli relations. The Obama administration says additional settlements will undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Prime Minister Netanyahu is set to arrive in the U.S. for talks tomorrow.\n\n\n\nThose are your top stories here on State of the Union. Up next, John King, the man who used to sit in this very room, will be here for a preview of his new # p.m. show, John King, USA.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Loyal followers of State of the Union will want to watch -- in fact, I demand that they watch my colleague, John King's, new broadcast, John King, USA. It premiers tomorrow evening. It's a program with a distinctive look and feel. But this guy, who they are familiar with, let me first -- to start you, though, because you are going to be following this all next week...\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: We hear -- and probably the week after.\n\n\n\nKING: And the week after.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: John Larson says they got the votes. Do they?\n\n\n\nKING: Well, one of the deputy whips also said this morning not quite. I believe that -- you know how this works. We will see. Just as they are casting the votes, in the final minutes, there will be three or four people standing in a cluster over here and three or four standing in a cluster over there. They'll be talking to the whips and the leadership sources.\n\n\n\nAnd a few of them said, Madam Speaker, if you need me, i will vote yes, but I'd like to keep my job and I'd prefer to vote no. And so they'll figure it out to the very end. So there -- they would not be doing this if they were not confident they would get there at the end. there is always a few -- little bit of trading at the end.\n\n\n\nAnd then -- and you have had a fascinating discussion about it this morning -- then this becomes a Washington conversation from now to November and, more importantly, an American conversation between now and November. In this midterm election season, you know, sometimes we say this is not about anything. This is going to be about something huge.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: It's amazing, because you really could hear the campaigns revving up, sitting here, because everybody knows this train is -- has left the station and is about to pull up someplace.\n\n\n\nOK, tell me about the show. I mean, first of all, a whole -- I did watch it online when you did your -- your soft -- what do they call it, soft rollout or whatever that is? Just tell me about it and, like, what the feel is you are going for and what you are hoping to do.\n\n\n\nKING: On the set, we are trying to be a little bit more relaxed and casual, a little more personal. All my things are on the set. you will see campaign buttons that i have collected for the last ## years. you will see a couple of Fenway Park signs and Red Sox logos. that is who I am.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: Surprising.\n\n\n\nKING: Surprising. But it's like trying to bring somebody in your home or your place in a relaxed way to hopefully have more open and candid conversations. Day-to-day television is a little different from Sunday television. And, you know, I love what you have done with this space on Sunday.\n\n\n\nAnd, look, the mission of the program is to do -- take where you start here on Sundays and then project it out in the country. When these guys talk about we are on the side of the American people, let's see if the House and the Senate pass this bill if the American people feel that way between now and November, so we will go to their communities. we are in their communities this week watching the protests, watching the debates, the phone calls come in to all these offices. we will do it between now and November. This is one of the things in Washington that can seem like it's an all-Washington confrontation. Health care reform affects everybody; ### million people in the United States of America will be affected one way or another by this bill, whether they like it or not. So let's cover the big debates here in Washington, but connect them to the impact out in the country. And that is what we are going to try to do.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: So when I looked at it online, it really was -- it seems like you are going more for that conversational. It's not your sort of evening news broadcast. Is that the feel of it?\n\n\n\nKING: I think that is exactly right. It's a news program. It's not a traditional newscast. We want it to be a community and a conversation, not cable conflict, people going at it.\n\n\n\nIf you want to come in -- you can be on the far left and the far right, but come in to have a conversation that is about what is in the bill. Object to the specifics of the policy we are discussing -- discussing, not, say, because you are a D and i am an R, you are evil and we are just going to yell at each other. Let's come in and let's have a conversation, keep it civil, but it can still be about something.\n\n\n\nAnd also we are going to reach out to people who do not live, breathe, eat, and sleep politics in Washington, D.C., but are involved in the process, people who are motivating all those conservatives. Maybe they are tea party people. Maybe they are new faces who are organizing the conservative community.\n\n\n\nAnd the same is on the left. As you know, one of the fascinating questions in this campaign, Republicans have the intensity right now, and conservatives -- not always the same thing. Can the left, if they pass this bill -- and that is what a lot of what this is about -- the president trying to say, look, we will lose if we do not get our base back in this election season. One way to try to get them back is to make the tough votes and pass this bill. So that is what we want to track.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: John King, USA, # p.m. Eastern tomorrow night. Be sure and watch.\n\n\n\nKING: Thank you.\n\n\n\nCROWLEY: We will be there, as well. John and the rest of the best political team on television will also be here this afternoon for today's coverage of the health care vote. And until then, for our international viewers, World Report is next. For everybody else, Fareed Zakaria GPS starts right now.\n\n\n\n"

These names might not sound familiar, but these guys have also reported raising money for a presidential bid this cycle\u2014and in some cases have actually collected more than (slightly) better-known candidates. Cox, a Republican described as a Reagan fiscal and social conservative on his website, has raised $###,### this year, which is more than Alan Keyes has raised, and Cox has more cash on hand than the newcomer. Lamagna, a progressive activist who has produced three documentaries about the Iraq war, has raised $###,###, which is more than Mike Gravel raised. Both Cox and Lamagna, however, have accrued pretty significant debt. Cox is in the hole $#.# million, almost twice more than he's brought in, and Lamagna's debt is $###,###. But because they are both funding their own campaigns, they owe the money to themselves. Other lesser-known candidates are libertarians or members of other third parties. Military Continues to Give to Paul, Obama (##/##/##, #:## pm)\n\nDespite his anti-war stance, or perhaps because of it, Ron Paul continues to collect more money from members of the U.S. military than any other presidential candidate, including John McCain, a Vietnam War prisoner who backs the administration's policy in Iraq. Paul brought in at least $##,### from the uniformed services, compared to McCain's $##,###. Democrat Barack Obama, who opposed the resolution to go to Iraq from the start, is the number-two recipient with at least $##,###. This trend may exemplify growing dissatisfaction among members of the military with the administration's handling of foreign policy, especially in Iraq. Democrats have received ## percent of the total $###,### in contributions from uniformed service members this year. By comparison, in ####, the last presidential race before the Iraq war began, Democrats received only ## percent of contributions from the military. *Read a Capital Eye story from September about military giving: The Other Iraq Surge Battle of the Sexes (##/##/##, ##:## pm)\n\nHillary Clinton, the only woman running for president, is bringing in more money from female donors than any other candidate. But she does not have the largest number of female donors. That distinction belongs to Democrat Barack Obama, who has so far collected money from at least ##,### women giving more than $###, compared to Clinton's ##,###. (Only donors who give more than $### are itemized in campaign finance reports, so it's impossible to determine a gender breakdown for smaller donors.) Clinton is nearly tied with Democrat Dennis Kucinich in the percentage of total funds coming from women\u2014about ## percent for both of them. Among Republicans, a larger number of women have given to Mitt Romney than any other candidate in the party, #,### donors giving a total of $##.# million, or about ## percent of his total. But with about ## percent of his funds from women, dropout Sam Brownback's receipts from females make up the largest percentage of his total compared to all other GOP candidates. Hedge Funds and Private Equity Invest in Giuliani, Democrats (##/##/##, ##:## am)\n\nAs senators, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are debating legislation that would significantly increase taxes on hedge funds and private equity firms. As presidential hopefuls, the two are raking in money from the industry, while Mitt Romney, who made his fortune in private equity, is seeing a decline in contributions from them. Nearly ## percent of the $#.# million in donations from hedge funds and private equity firms went to Democrats during the third quarter.

    "text": "Obama addresses key concerns for Floridians\n\nRelated Links Watch complete interview\n\nIn an exclusive one-on-one interview this afternoon at the White House, News Channel # anchor Keith Cate asked President Barack Obama questions about the economy, health care and Republican leadership.\n\nKeith: Let me start with the economy, Mr. President. Unemployment in the state of Florida is higher than the national average.\n\nObama: Right.\n\nKeith: ##.# percent. What does this new tax deal do for those #.# million Floridians who are looking for work, and what does it do for the businesses that have been reluctant to hire and maybe in some circumstances, because of the economy, cannot afford to hire?\n\nObama: Well, first of all, you are absolutely right. Florida was as hard hit as any state in the country -- partly because the housing market in Florida really took a hit. And in those states where the housing market went up and then went down very rapidly, that really hurt the economy generally. This tax package does a couple of things immediately for economic growth in Florida. Number one, for those folks looking for work right now, it extends their unemployment benefits. Two million people across the country would lose their unemployment benefits at the end of this month if we did not move forward on this tax agreement. And economists say that not only is that good for those families, it's good for the entire economy. It's probably the biggest boost that we can give an economy because those folks are most likely to spend the money with businesses, and that gives them customers. The second thing it does is make sure that no middle class family's taxes go up starting on Jan. #. Because the taxes are structured, they were set to expire automatically at the end of this year. Which meant that if Congress does nothing, people's paychecks are smaller. Now that is not going to be good for the economy at a time when people feel pinched -- the notion that somehow they have $#,###, $#,###, $#,### worth of taxes to pay, that is a big problem. The third thing it does is it reduces payroll taxes for everybody in Florida. Which means that now people have a little more money in their pockets, they are more likely to spend, they are more likely to be confident about the direction of the economy. Fourth, it makes sure that all the business provisions that we had put in place a couple years ago to incentivize investments in clean energy, solar power, wind power -- investments in plants and equipment -- that all those investments, tax credits continue into next year and the year after that. So economists generally estimate whereas they were predicting #.# percent growth next year, they think that if this tax package goes through, they think that we may end up having #.# or # percent growth. And that extra percent of growth could mean an extra #.# million jobs throughout the country. that is going to be good for Florida.\n\nKeith: What is your relationship with the Republican leadership at this point going forward? A lot of the country looks and goes bipartisanship, but after the agreement was worked out you used the term hostage taker -- you did not like dealing with hostage takers. Do you still feel that same way? what is your view of the Republican Party today?\n\nObama: The truth of the matter is, I get along fine with Mitch McConnell and I get along fine with John Boehner. On this narrow issue, I disagreed with their approach. My preference would have been to provide all those good things that I just described but not give tax breaks to the top #, # percent. Folks like me that frankly do not need a tax break. i am not going to change my spending patterns because I get a tax break. If there is something I need, i am going to buy it. i am not the person who needs it and who's going to add to our deficit. So I still think that it was the wrong thing to do and it did not make sense for us to hold up the tax breaks for middle class families because the high-end tax breaks were going to elapse. But that is a philosophical difference i have got with the Republican Party. we are going to keep on arguing about that well into the next couple years -- both on their side and on my side. But I do think this package required me to take some things I did not like. It requires them to take some things they do not like. They do not really want to, I think, extend unemployment insurance as long as we are extending it or provide college tax credits or child tax credits to people who need them. And that is part of the compromise that we are probably going to have to look at on a whole host of different issues.\n\nKeith: Let me get your opinion if I could on high-speed transit. In the state of Florida the federal government is promising or pledging up to $#.# billion, $#.# billion to fund a rail line between Tampa and Orlando. Ohio and Wisconsin said we are not into this, so they gave back some of the money and in fact Florida picked up another $### million. The governor-elect Rick Scott said he's not so sure about a high-speed connection between Tampa and Orlando. What is the argument for that -- if you agree with that -- when Ohio and Wisconsin say it's not such a good idea.\n\nObama: Well look, let's face it. Some of this is wrapped up in politics. This was my idea that we should make sure that states that want to pursue high-speed rail get help from the federal government. Folks who are running against Democrats, a Democratic president, I understand that. If you go to other countries, they are cleaning our clock when it comes to infrastructure. you have got high-speed rail in China that is moving people around in ways that make our rail systems look archaic. they are investing in airports that make our airports look completely outdated. Their ports, their roads. Infrastructure across the board is going in an upward direction while our infrastructure is deteriorating. And that is not my estimation -- that is the estimation of professional engineers. So when you look at, for example, the opportunities of high-speed rail linking together key cities in Florida and historically how the rail systems have been able to promote business and economic growth and greater efficiency and fewer commuter times, it is a good thing not only by putting people to work right away but by fostering economic growth over the long term. This was an idea that has great enthusiasm among local civic leaders in those cities. And my hope is that everybody looks at this objectively and take the politics out of it. If they do, then I think Florida will benefit in part from decisions that were made in Wisconsin and Ohio that I do not think will serve their people well.\n\nKeith: Quickly, if I could get your reaction to what took place in Richmond, Va., today. I know you have been asked about this, but I'd like to hear it from you directly \u2013 when it comes to the health care decision, that parts of it are unconstitutional. What does that do? Your opinion on health care? what is your reaction to that ruling?\n\nObama: I have not read the full ruling. i have just gotten a synopsis on it. But keep in mind this is one ruling by one federal district court. we have already had two federal district courts that have ruled that this is definitely constitutional. we have got ## federal courts who have dismissed similar lawsuits, So the majority of courts who looked at this issue so far are absolutely convinced that the health care bill is [constitutional]. you have got one judge who disagreed. that is the nature of these things. When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits. When the civil rights act was passed and the voting rights act was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits. We are absolutely confident that the basic issue that this judge identified -- that we say that in order to make sure that insurance companies have to provide care to people with pre-existing conditions, we have got to make sure that everybody has some kind of insurance -- the same way that they have car insurance. that is something that makes sense to most people. Think about it -- when it comes to car insurance, we would not say that you can wait until you get into a car wreck and then you can go to the insurance company, say hey, I want to buy some insurance for my car. If you cannot do that for car insurance, why can you do that for health insurance. How can you wait until you get sick and then go and say I want to buy some insurance? That is not fair and I think most people understand it is not fair. All we have said is everybody has to get some basic insurance so that we are not paying for you when you get sick. And that helps keep everybody's cost down and it makes sure that that insurance company cannot discriminate against you if you have got pre-existing conditions. It's the right thing to do, and i am confident that the courts will uphold it.\n\nKeith: When might you be coming back to the state of Florida? I do not know if you have heard but the beaches are clean and the water is pure. Any thoughts on a business trip or maybe a pleasure trip to the state of Florida? Open for business.\n\nObama: Let me tell you -- if there is any time in January, February or March where I can get to Florida, i am going to take that opportunity. Because I do not know if you have noticed, but it's a little chilly outside right here.\n\nKeith: It is, but it's cold in Florida today. Mr. President, thank you so much."

Abqaiq (## billion barrels of proven reserves) produces approximately ###,### bbl/d ## o API Arab Extra Light crude. Since ####, the Najd fields, which includes the Hawtah field and smaller satellites (Nuayyim, Hazmiyah) south of Riyadh, have been producing around ###,### bbl/d of ## o -## o API, #.## percent sulphur, Arab Super Light. Offshore production includes Arab Medium crude from the Zuluf (over ###,### bbl/d capacity) and Marjan (###,### bbl/d capacity) fields and Arab Heavy crude from the Safaniya field. Most Saudi oil production, except for extra light and super light, is considered sour, containing relatively high levels of sulfur. The Ghawar field is the main producer of # million bbl/d of ##API Arabian Light crude. Abqaiq (## billion barrels of proven reserves) produces approximately ###,### bbl/d ##API Arab Extra Light crude. Since ####, the Najd fields, which includes the Hawtah field and smaller satellites (Nuayyim, Hazmiyah) south of Riyadh, have been producing around ###,### bbl/d of ##-##API, #.## percent sulphur, Arab Super Light. Offshore production includes Arab Medium crude from the Zuluf (over ###,### bbl/d capacity) and Marjan (###,### bbl/d capacity) fields and Arab Heavy crude from the Safaniya field. Most Saudi oil production, except for extra light and super light, is considered sour, containing relatively high levels of sulfur. The $#-billion project, known as the Qatif Producing Facilities Development Program (QPFDP), involved construction of two gas-oil separation plants (GOSPs), as well as gas treatment and oil stabilization facilities, for the Qatif and Abu Saafa oilfields (Abu Saafa is half owned by Bahrain). Additional production from these fields was slated to replace production elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, not to boost overall capacity. Despite recent OPEC cuts, Saudi Aramco continues aggressive plans to increase capacity; the following is a table of planed production capacity increases through ####. In addition to these capacity increases, Saudi Aramco has said that it will also conduct additional drilling at existing fields in order to help compensate for the natural declines from the mature fields. o API sweet (nearly sulfur-free) Arab Extra Light crude oil, with production as of November ####, at around ###,### bbl/d from ### wells. It is the largest oil field in the world that has been developed in the past two decades. According to Oil Minister Naimi (October ####), the development of Shaybah showed that the cost of adding...capacity - that is, all the infrastructure, producing and transportation facilities - necessary to produce one additional barrel of oil per day in Saudi Arabia is, at most, $#,### compared to between $##,### and $##,### in most areas of the world. Saudi Arabia's long-term goal is to further develop its lighter crude reserves including the Shaybah field, located in the remote Empty Quarter (Rub al-Khali) area bordering the United Arab Emirates. (In June ####, the UAE said it wanted to amend a #### border pact which gave the Saudis rights to Shaybah, which lies ## percent in Saudi territory and ## percent in UAE). Shaybah contains an estimated ##.# billion barrels of premium grade ##.#API sweet (nearly sulfur-free) Arab Extra Light crude oil, with production as of November ####, at around ###,### bbl/d from ### wells. It is the largest oil field in the world that has been developed in the past two decades. According to Oil Minister Naimi (October ####), the development of Shaybah showed that the cost of adding...capacity - that is, all the infrastructure, producing and transportation facilities - necessary to produce one additional barrel of oil per day in Saudi Arabia is, at most, $#,### compared to between $##,### and $##,### in most areas of the world. \u00b7 The Shaybah complex includes three gas/oil separation plants (GOSPs) and a ###-mile pipeline to connect the field to Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia's closest gathering center, for blending with Arab Light crude (Berri and Abqaiq streams). In addition to oil, Shaybah has a large natural gas cap (associated gas), with estimated reserves of ## trillion cubic feet (Tcf). Gas production of ### million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) is re-injected. It is reported that possible gas recovery project could be implemented within # or # years, potentially for use in petrochemical production. \u00b7 The Khurais fields (including Abu Jifan and Mazalij) west of Ghawar, will increase Saudi production capacity (of Arab Light) by #.# million bbl/d at a cost of $# billion. Once online, Saudi Arabia will be the only oil producer to have two \u201csuper giant\u201d fields, that which produce more than # million bbl/d of crude oil. This is to involve installation of four GOSPs, with a capacity of ###,### bbl/d each, at Khurais, which first came online in the ####, but was mothballed by Aramco some three-decades later. Aramco plans to drill at least ### exploration wells with ## rigs. \u00b7 Several other fields -- Abu Hadriya (#.#-#.# billion barrels in reserves), Fadhili (#-#.# billion barrels), Harmaliya, Khursaniya (#.# billion barrels), and Manifa estimated ## \u2013 ## billion barrels) -- also mothballed by the Saudis during the ####s and ####s, will be brought back online given Saudi desire to maintain spare or \u201cswing\u201d production capacity. In particular, Saudi Aramco is pushing ahead with development of the Abu Hadriya, Fadhili and Khursaniya (AFK) onshore fields. In March ####, the Saudis awarded eight contracts for work at Khursaniya and also at Hawiya (see below). Production of ###,### bbl/d (medium, ## o API) of Arab Light from the AFK fields in on-track for late ####. Besides AFK, the Saudis are planning to increase Arab Light production from the #-billion-barrel Nuayyim onshore field by ###,### bbl/d in ####. \u00b7 The $#.# million Haradh-# project increased production capacity at the Haradh oil field (which part of Ghawar) to ###,### bbl/d by in April ####. The expansion involves adding a third, ###,###-bbl/d GOSP to Haradh (in addition to two other ###,###-bbl/d GOSPs, one of which was inaugurated in January ####). Haradh also is also producing significant volumes of non-associated natural gas, natural gas condensates and sulfur. The project was carried out by Aramco, along with private partners. \u00b7 In their #### annual report, Saudi Aramco reported five smaller discoveries, three of which were predominantly oil. The new fields include Du'ayban, with #,### bbl/ day of Arabian Super Light, Halfa, with #,### bbl/d of Arabian Extra Light; and Muraiqib with #,### bb/d Arab Light. Also, Aramco reported a successful extension of reserves outside the booked reserves area at Fadhili, northeast of Riyadh. According to the report, the discovery could increase reserves by \u201capproximately ### million barrels of original oil in place, of which\u2026### million barrels, is recoverable.\u201d Saudi-Kuwaiti Neutral Zone; Bahrain\n\nproduction of the Abu Saafa offshore field. The Saudi-Kuwait Divided Zone, #### sq mi between the borders of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that was left undefined in ####, contains an estimated # billion barrels of proven oil reserves, divided equally between the two countries. Within the Divided Zone, Japan's Arabian Oil Co. (AOC) traditionally operated two offshore fields (Khafji and Hout) with ###,### bbl/d in production (now approximately ###,### bbl/d), but in February ####, it lost the concession (in January ####, AOC reached an agreement with Kuwait on the right to purchase at least ###,### bbl/d of crude for the next ## years from Khafji). Efforts to negotiate an extension of the operating contract with Saudi authorities failed when Japan refused to commit to investment in development projects desired by the Saudis. Saudi Aramco has taken over operation of the former AOC fields. ChevronTexaco, meanwhile, operates three onshore fields (Wafra, South Fawaris, and South Umm Gudair) in the Divided Zone under a ##-year license that expires in ####. These fields have # billion barrels of proven reserves and total production of about ###,### bbl/d. Finally, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia share the ###,### bbl/dof the Abu Saafa offshore field. Refining\n\nOil and Gas Journal , Saudi Arabia has seven functioning refineries, with combined crude throughput capacity of around #.# million bbl/d, plus around #.## million bbl/d of refining capacity overseas, making it the sixth largest oil refiner in the world. The Saudi Aramco development plan calls for a $##-billion investment, increasing domestic refining capacity to # million bbl/d and international holdings by at least #-# million bbl/d by ####, particularly in an effort to meet requirements of the fast-growing Asian market.

Saudi Aramco is also aiming to increase private investment through join ventures in downstream petroleum activities. In March ####, France\u2019s Total and Saudi Aramco announced plans to build a $#-billion, ###,###-###,### bbl/d export-oriented refinery in Jubail. Also in ####, Aramco signed an MOU with Conoco Philips for a ###,###-bbl/d heavy conversion facility at Yanbu. As part of the privatization program, ## percent of shares will reportedly be offered to the public. Reportedly, Aramco is considering putting out a tender for a privately-owned refinery at the port-city of Jizan \u00b7 Last year Saudi Aramco and Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Chemical broke ground on the $#.#-billion Rabigh Refining and Petrochemical joint venture (PETRORabigh) - one of the biggest projects of its kind. Rabigh will be upgraded to ###,### bbl/d (from ###,### bbl/d), while shifting the product mix away from low-value heavy products towards gasoline and kerosene, while integrating the site with a new petrochemicals plan. The refinery will come online in ####. At the same time, Aramco announced ###,### bbl/d expansion and integration with neighboring petrochemical plants upgrades for Ras Tanura and Yanbu by #### to ####. \u00b7 Overseas, Saudi Arabia has interests in refineries in the US, South Korea, Japan and the Phillippeans . In July ####, a new, $#.# -billion ###,### bbl/d refinery and petrochemical plant complex was inaugurated in Fujian, China. The facility is a joint venture between Sinopec (## percent), ExxonMobil (## percent), and Saudi Aramco (## percent). Crude oil for the plant is to be supplied by Saudi Arabia under a long-term agreement, and will come online in ####/####. Aramco reports that capacity will be increased to ###,### in the next few year. Aramco is also in talks with Sinopec to participate in the ongoing construction of a second facility in the northern province of Shandong (Qingdao). Both plants are expected to be able to handle high sulphur (sour) oils, as there is a dearth of such capacity worldwide. \u00b7 In July ####, Aramco signed an agreement with Shell to purchase a ## percent share in Showa Shell Group, a refining and marketing company based in Japan. Under the deal, Aramco will supply Showa Shell with ###,### bbl/d of crude oil. Saudi Arabia also owns a #.# percent share in AOC Holdings, which operates the ###,### b/d Sodegaura refinery in Japan through a subsidiary, Fuji Oil. \u00b7 In the Philippines, Aramco is conducting preliminary studies on a new $#-billion refinery at Mindanao, which will supply East Asia and the US West Coast. Aramco is also a ## percent shareholder in Philippine Petron, which runs a ###,### b/d refinery on the island. \u00b7 In March ####, Saudi Arabia and India signed an agreement on oil cooperation; with the Saudis reportedly interested in acquiring a stake in India Oil Company\u2019s expansion of the ###,###-bbl/d Paradip refinery (it will reach ###,###-bbl/d by ####). Saudi Aramco is reportedly considering taking a stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited's (HPCL) Vishakhapatnam refinery (###,### bbl/d capacity), which will be doubled in capacity by ####-ll. \u00b7 In the United States, Aramco and partner Royal Dutch/Shell are planning an expansion of at least one of their three Motiva joint-venture refineries in Louisiana and Texas. The three facilities have a total capacity of around ###,###, approximately # percent of the US refining market. There are detailed plans to expand the ###,### b/d Port Arthur, Texas facility to ###,### bbl/d by ####. According to Aramco, however, future expansion plans will increase total capacity by ###,### bbl/d. Saudi Aramco owns ## percent of Motiva though their subsidiary, Saudi Refining. \u00b7 Aramco also has reported interests in South Korea's Sangyong Oil Refining Company and Motor Oil (Hellas) in Greece. Security Issues\n\nThe Saudi petroleum pipeline and export network (and energy sector in general) remains a terrorism target. In February ####, Saudi security prevented an attempted suicide bomb attack at the Abqaiq petroleum processing facility, after Al-Qaeda leadership called for renewed attacks against the country\u2019s economic backbone. Nevertheless, energy infrastructure remains well-protected. Following the February incident, the government increased the National Guard and military security force to approximately ##,###, in addition to the #### guards employed directly by Aramco. Reportedly, security spending has been ramped up since a series of attacks against energy infrastructure and foreign nationals were carried out in ####. In addition to direct security, Saudi Arabia is known to ensure export security by maintaining redundancy (i.e., multiple options for transportation and export) in its oil system, in part as a form of indirect security against any one facility being disabled."

    "text": "Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: The Past Versus the Future\n\nDenver, CO | January ##, ####\n\n\n\nThank you Caroline - for your introduction, your support, and your lifetime of service to a grateful nation. You continue to inspire Americans of all ages and walks of life.\n\nLet me also say a few words about another American who has called us to a common purpose. John Edwards has spent a lifetime fighting to give voice to the voiceless and hope to the struggling. At a time when our politics is too focused on who's up and who's down, he made us focus on who matters - the New Orleans child without a home, the West Virginia miner without a job, the families who live in that other America that is not seen or heard or talked about in Washington. John and Elizabeth Edwards believe deeply that two Americans can become one. Their campaign may have ended, but this cause lives on for all of us who believe that we can achieve one America.\n\nSeven months from now, the Democratic Party will gather here in Denver to nominate our candidate for President of the United States.\n\nWe will come together after a long and hard fought primary campaign - and that is a good thing. Because it is through campaigns that we hear directly from the American people, set our common goals, and debate our differences. It is through campaigns that we bring new people into the process; build new coalitions; and renew who we are and what we stand for as a Party.\n\nIt is fitting that the journey leads to Denver - a city that is younger than the Democratic Party itself, but filled with the promise that our Party has always fought for. This city, built at the base of the Rocky Mountains, stands as a monument to a uniquely American belief in things unseen. Here, in Denver, fur trappers and traders; gold rushers and ranchers; came in search of opportunity, and made the future their own.\n\nThe story of America leads west. It is a story of ideals that know no boundaries. It is a story of immigrants who set out from distant shores; pioneers who persevered; and people of all races, religions, and ethnic groups who put aside their doubts to seek a new frontier.\n\nMy own family's journey moved west - from Kansas, where my grandparents met and married, and my mother was born; to the Pacific Coast after World War II; and then across an ocean to Hawaii. Their journey - like so many others - speaks to a simple truth written into the story of America. It's a truth at the foundation of the Democratic Party's purpose, Denver's progress, and our nation's promise: in America, the future is what we decide it's going to be.\n\nAs candidates, we must give new meaning to that promise. And seven months from now, one of us will stand before that convention hall, and give voice to the hopes, and dreams, and determination of Americans all across our country. In six days, you get to choose who will be that voice. You get to choose who will be able to build a new majority of not just Democrats - but Independents and Republicans - to win in November, and transform our country. And if you put your trust in me, I will stand up at that convention and say that our divisions are past, our hope is the future, and our time for change has come.\n\nNow there is one thing we know for certain about the election in November: the name George Bush will not be on the ballot. The name of my cousin - Dick Cheney - will not be on the ballot. But the choice before you is about what comes next. Because we need to do more than turn the page on the failed Bush-Cheney policies; we have to turn the page on the politics that helped make those policies possible.\n\nLobbyists setting an agenda in Washington that feeds the inequality, insecurity, and instability in our economy.\n\nDivision and distraction that keeps us from coming together to deal with challenges like health care, and clean energy, and crumbling schools year after year after year.\n\nCronyism that gave us Katrina instead of competent government. And secrecy that made torture permissible and illegal wiretaps possible.\n\nIt's a politics that uses #/## to scare up votes; and fear and falsehoods to lead us into a war in Iraq that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged.\n\nEach candidate running for the Democratic nomination shares an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration. But we must decide - in the debate that leads to Denver - just what kind of Party we want to be, and what lessons we have learned from the bitter partisanship of the last two decades. We can be a Party that tries to beat the other side by practicing the same do-anything, say-anything, divisive politics that has stood in the way of progress; or we can be a Party that puts an end to it.\n\nI am running for President because I believe that we need fundamental change in America. Not just a change of Party in the White House, but change in Washington that the American people can believe in - unity instead of division; hope instead of fear; a politics that leaves behind the fights of the past so that we can finally take hold of our future.\n\nWe began this campaign one year ago on the steps of the old statehouse in Springfield. At the time, we made a bet on the American people. That bet was simple - we were not going to change anything by relying on the same Washington games; instead, we were betting on the American people's hunger for change, and your ability to make change happen from the bottom-up.\n\nAnd we are showing America what change looks like. From the snows of Iowa to the sunshine of South Carolina, we have built a movement of young and old; rich and poor; black and white; Latino, Asian and Native American. we have reached Americans of all political stripes who are more interested in turning the page than turning up the heat on our opponents. that is how Democrats will win in November and build a majority in Congress. Not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us, but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who does not take a dime from Washington lobbyists and PACs. We do not need a candidate who agrees with Republicans that lobbyists are part of the system in Washington. they are part of the problem. And when i am President, their days of setting the agenda in Washington will be over.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who does not just tell people what they want to hear. Poll-tested positions and calculated answers might be how Washington confronts challenges, but it's not how you overcome them; it's not how you inspire our nation to come together behind a common purpose; and it's not what America needs right now.\n\nIf you choose change, you will have a nominee who is not just playing on the same electoral map where half the country starts out against us, because you will have a nominee who has already brought in more Independents and Republicans; young people and new voters; than we have seen in a generation.\n\nI know it is tempting - after another presidency by a man named George Bush - to simply turn back the clock, and to build a bridge back to the ##th Century. There are those will tell us that our Party should nominate someone who is more practiced in the art of pursuing power; that is it's not yet our turn or our time. There was also a time when Caroline Kennedy's father was counseled by a former President to \u201cbe patient,\u201d and to step aside for \u201csomeone with greater experience.\u201d But John F. Kennedy responded by saying, \u201cThe world is changing. The old ways will not do\u2026It is time for a new generation of leadership.\u201d\n\nIt is time for a new generation of leadership, because the old politics just will not do. I am running for President - right now - because I have met Americans all across this country who cannot afford to wait another day for change. That is why the real choice in this campaign is not between regions or religions or genders. It's not about rich versus poor; young versus old; and it is not about black versus white.\n\nIt is about the past versus the future. And when I am the nominee, the Republicans will not be able to make this election about the past because you will have already chosen the future.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for an economy where families are being forced to foreclose on their dreams, and workers have seen their pensions disappear.\n\nIn the short-term, we need what I have consistently called for - a stimulus plan that gives the American people a tax rebate, and that also extends relief to seniors and expands unemployment insurance. And in the long-term, we need to put the American Dream on a firmer foundation. we are not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who voted to put the banks and big business ahead of hard-working Americans. i have been fighting for working people my entire public life. And when I am President, i will make sure that CEOs cannot dump your pension with one hand while they collect a bonus with the other. i will pass bankruptcy laws that protect workers instead of banks. And i will crack down on fraudulent mortgage lenders, and credit card companies that change your rates to push you further into debt.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for the Maytag worker who is now competing with his own teenage son for a $# an-hour job at Walmart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors.\n\nwe are not going to offer the American people the choice they need by nominating a candidate who argues year after year for trade that is not fair, but calls for a time-out on trade when they run for President. I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans. I will stop giving the wealthiest Americans tax cuts that they do not need and did not ask for, and restore fairness to our economy. i will give a tax cut to working people; provide relief to homeowners; and eliminate the income tax for seniors making under $##,### so they can retire with the dignity and security they have earned.\n\nIt's time for new leadership for the woman I met who cannot get Medicaid to cover the needs of her sick child.\n\nShe cannot afford to wait another four years or another fifteen years to get health care because we have put forward a nominee who cannot bring Democrats and Republicans together to get things done. I know that the reason Americans do not have health care is not because no one is forcing them to buy it - it's because they cannot afford it. that is why my plan cuts costs by up to $#### for a typical family, and makes health care available and affordable for every single American. that is the plan that i will pass in my first term as President.\n\nIt is time for new leadership for children going to overcrowded schools in East L.A.; for the teacher I met who is working at Dunkin Donuts to make ends meet; for the young people who are ready to go to college but cannot afford it.\n\nWhen i am President, we will rally this country to the cause of world-class education. That means putting our kids on a pathway to success with universal, quality, affordable early childhood education. That means paying our teachers more, and making sure they are not just teaching to the test - but teaching art and music and literature. That means giving our young people an annual $#,### tax credit for college tuition if they serve their community; and that means expanding AmeriCorps to ###,### slots, and issuing a call to service for a new generation. But that also means calling on parents to do their part - to get off the couch, turn off the television, and read to our children. Because responsibility for education starts at home.\n\nIt's time for new leadership so that my daughters and your children do not grow up in a century where our economy is weighed down by our addiction to oil; our foreign policy is held hostage to the whims of dictators; and our planet passes a moment of no return.\n\nWhen i am President, we will not wait any longer to reduce emissions. When I called for higher fuel efficiency standards, I did not do it in front of an environmental group in California or in Boulder - that would have been the easy thing to do. I did it in front of the automakers in Detroit. Now it was pretty quiet - I did not get a lot of applause. But we need leadership that tells the American people not just what they want to hear, but what we need to know. that is what i will do. We cannot wait to invest in the next generation of biofuels, and wind and solar. If President Kennedy could send us to the moon in less than a decade - then we can meet this great challenge our generation. We can set the goal of an ##% reduction in global emissions by ####, and we can lead the world to confront the climate crisis.\n\nAnd it's time for new leadership for the woman who told me that she has not been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for Iraq, and the soldier who does not know his own child because he's on his third or fourth tour of duty.\n\nI will end the mentality that says the only way for Democrats to look tough on national security is by talking, acting and voting like George Bush Republicans. It's time to reject the counsel that says the American people would rather have someone who is strong and wrong than someone who is weak and right - it's time to say that we are the Party that is going to be strong and right.\n\nIt's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq; who agreed with him by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; who agrees with him in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we do not like; and who actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed.\n\nWe need to offer the American people a clear contrast on national security, and when I am the nominee of the Democratic Party, that is exactly what I will do. Talking tough and tallying up your years in Washington is no substitute for judgment, and courage, and clear plans. It's not enough to say you will be ready from Day One - you have to be right from Day One.\n\nI opposed this war in Iraq from the start, and I have never, ever wavered in that opposition. I warned about taking our eye off of Osama bin Laden, and overstretching our troops and their families as we have seen in communities across this country like Fort Carson. And when I am President, I will immediately begin to remove our troops, I will finally put meaningful pressure on Iraq's leaders to reconcile, and I will end this war. And I will do what we should have done back in ####: increase our commitment to Afghanistan, press Pakistan to take action against terror, and finish the fight with al Qaeda.\n\nI will challenge the conventional thinking that says we cannot conduct diplomacy with leaders we do not like. Strong countries and strong Presidents talk to their adversaries as well as their friends, and that is what i will do. And when I am President, we will keep nuclear weapons from terrorists by securing all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term in office. We will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and we will pursue it.\n\nIt's time for new leadership that reaches out, as President Kennedy did to my own father, to people \u201cin the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery.\u201d\n\nIt's time to restore our moral leadership by rejecting torture without equivocation; by closing Guantanamo; by restoring habeas corpus; and by again being that light of justice to dissidents in prison camps around the globe. It's time for America to lead the world against the common threats of the ##st century - terrorism and nuclear weapons, but also climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. I will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, \u201cYou matter to us. Your future is our future. And our moment is now.\u201d\n\nThis is what the moment demands of us - to cast off our doubts; to reach once more for what America can be if we have the courage to make the future our own.\n\nwe have been warned, in these last few weeks, that this kind of change is not possible. That we are peddling false hopes. That we need a reality check.\n\nAnd we have faced forces that are not the fault of any one campaign - forces that open American wounds. The politics that uses religion as a wedge, and patriotism as a bludgeon. A politics that tells us what we have to think and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us. The assumption that young people are apathetic. The assumption that Republicans will not cross over. The assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor, and that the poor do not vote. The assumption that African-Americans cannot support the white candidate; whites cannot support the African-American candidate; and blacks and Latinos cannot come together.\n\nBut our Party - the Democratic Party - has always been at its best when we rose above these divisions; when we called all Americans to a common purpose, a higher purpose; when we stood up and said that we will write our own future, and the future will be what we want it to be.\n\nWe followed a King to the mountaintop, and a Kennedy who called on us to reject the mindless menace of violence.\n\nwe are the party of a young President who asked what we could do for our country, and who put us on a path to the moon.\n\nwe are the party of a man who overcame his own disability; who told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself; and who faced down fascism and liberated a continent from tyranny.\n\nwe are the party of Jackson, who took back the White House for the people of this country.\n\nAnd we are the party of Jefferson, who wrote the words that we are still trying to heed - that all of us are created equal - and who sent us West to blaze new trails, to make new discoveries, and to realize the promise of our highest ideals.\n\nThat is who we are. That is the Party that we need to be, and can be, if we cast off our doubts, and leave behind our fears, and choose the America that we know is possible. Because there is a moment in the life of every generation, if it is to make its mark on history, when its spirit has to come through, when it must choose the future over the past, when it must make its own change from the bottom up.\n\nThis is our moment. This is our message - the same message we had when we were up, and when we were down. The same message that we will carry all the way to the convention. And in seven months time - right here in Denver - we can realize this promise; we can claim this legacy; we can choose new leadership for America. Because there is nothing we cannot do if the American people decide it is time."

He introduces the commercial by saying that he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background.

She and Bill even had me take two surveys to assess her chances of winning. The conclusion was that she could not win because people would just see her as a seat warmer for when Bill came back licking his wounds after losing for president. So she did not run. Bill did and won. But there is no question she had her eye on public office, as opposed to service, long ago.\n\n\n\nBill says: In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor.\n\nThe true facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.\n\n\n\nBill says: Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids.\n\n\n\nThe true facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.\n\n\n\nBill says: Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers.\n\n\n\nThe true facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She only joined the prestigious Rose Law Firm after Bill became Attorney General and made partner only after he was elected Governor.\n\n\n\nBill says: President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman.\n\n\n\nThe true facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his #### primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.\n\n\n\nBill says: She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital.\n\nThe true facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart board of directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.\n\n\n\nBill says: Hillary did not succeed at getting health care for all Americans in #### but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.\n\n\n\nThe true facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Bill Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.\n\n\n\nBill says: Hillary was the face of America all over the world.\n\n\n\nThe true facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic, and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.\n\n\n\nBill says: Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children's and women's issues.\n\n\n\nThe true facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid #-## victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation.\n\n\n\nHere is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our country when it comes to the war on terror:\n\n\n\n#. She wants to close GITMO & move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.\n\n#. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.\n\n#. She wants to grants constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.\n\n\n\n#. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells & supporters in the USA.\n\n#. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.I cannot think of a single bill Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our country in the War on Terror. But, I can think of a lot of comments she has made that weakens our country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us........She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned. She is a disaster for all Americans."

    "text": "On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Nov. #, ####, the topic was what the government knew about Fort Hood psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major who authorities say killed ## people and wounded ## others.\n\nThere is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe, Hannity said.\n\nNow, this is a terrorist act, Hannity said. What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?\n\n\n\nHere's the point, Hannity said, Barack Obama will not even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can.\n\nwe have heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the global war on terrorism phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out.\n\nWe did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase war on terrorism as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase war on terror, but only a couple of times.\n\nSo what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question.\n\nThe first was during a Jan. ##, ####, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase war on terror and frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.\n\n\n\nObama: I think that you are making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.\n\n\n\nAnd so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.\n\n\n\nBut to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.\n\nThe issue was again raised in a Feb. #, ####, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:\n\nCooper: i have noticed you do not use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you have only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?\n\nObama: Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations are not representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we are going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.\n\nCooper: So that is not a term you are going to be using much in the future?\n\nObama: You know, what I want to do is make sure that i am constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.\n\nSo Obama is not fond of the phrase war on terror. But did that ever become blanket White House policy?\n\nAccording to a Washington Post story in March, a memo ed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.'  According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials.\n\nKenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told the Washington Post there was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of a career civil servant.\n\nStill, you do not hear administration officials using the term war on terror, or the like, very often.\n\nObama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words terror or terrorism in a June #, ####, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world.\n\nThe absence of those words goes to the heart of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Aug. #, ####.\n\nAs many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on #/## and killed #,### people. We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al-Qaida\u2019s murderous agenda. These are the terrorists we will destroy. These are the extremists we will defeat.\n\nBrennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism. President Obama has articulated a clear policy \u2014 to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its allies, Brennan said. That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver.\n\nOur aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the war on terror. Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama will not use the term war on terrorism. And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase war on terror, Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase war on terrorism. And so we rate Hannity's statement True."

    "text": "Last week, President Obama offered a spirited defense of his party\u2019s values \u2014 in effect, of the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society. Immediately thereafter, as always happens when Democrats take a stand, the civility police came out in force. The president, we were told, was being too partisan; he needs to treat his opponents with respect; he should have lunch with them, and work out a consensus.\n\nThat\u2019s a bad idea. Equally important, it\u2019s an undemocratic idea.\n\nLet\u2019s review the story so far.\n\nTwo weeks ago, House Republicans released their big budget proposal, selling it to credulous pundits as a statement of necessity, not ideology \u2014 a document telling America What Must Be Done.\n\nBut it was, in fact, a deeply partisan document, which you might have guessed from the opening sentence: \u201cWhere the president has failed, House Republicans will lead.\u201d It hyped the danger of deficits, yet even on its own (not at all credible) accounting, spending cuts were used mainly to pay for tax cuts rather than deficit reduction. The transparent and obvious goal was to use deficit fears to impose a vision of small government and low taxes, especially on the wealthy.\n\nSo the House budget proposal revealed a yawning gap between the two parties\u2019 priorities. And it revealed a deep difference in views about how the world works."

    "text": "WASHINGTON, May #, #### \u0097 -- AMANPOUR (voice-over): This week, budget blowback.\n\n(UNKNOWN): We cannot afford it, you moron!\n\nAMANPOUR: As town halls across America erupt in anger over a plan to slash spending...\n\n(UNKNOWN): you are a liar!\n\nAMANPOUR: ... Republicans find themselves under fire.\n\n(UNKNOWN): ... he was yelling at me, cursing at me.\n\nAMANPOUR: I go to the heartland with the man behind the plan, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\n\nRYAN: Let's prove to them that Wisconsinites can have a civil debate.\n\nAMANPOUR: Then, in the crosshairs. A NATO bomb hits a house with Gadhafi inside, killing his son and three grandchildren. How will the strongman strike back? And how does it all end?\n\n(UNKNOWN): This was a direct operation to assassinate the leader of this country.\n\nAMANPOUR: what is the way out for the U.S.? A former administration insider weighs in.\n\nPlus, we are live from the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II gets one step closer to sainthood. Is the fast track too fast?\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the Newseum in Washington, This Week with Christiane Amanpour starts right now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: Welcome to our viewers here and around the world. There is a lot happening this Sunday, and we begin with unfolding news in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The Libyan government is condemning what it called, quote, a direct operation to assassinate Moammar Gadhafi, this after a NATO bomb hit Gadhafi's compound. It spared him, but killed three of his grandchildren and his youngest son. So could this be a game-changer in the war, which has dragged into a stalemate in recent weeks?\n\nWe go live now to Libya for the very latest on the ground. ABC's Miguel Marquez is in Benghazi, and the BBC's Christian Fraser is in Tripoli, where the attack took place.\n\nChristian, let's start with you. Is there a feeling now that the war is entering a new phase around Tripoli?\n\nFRASER: I think that is a very real possibility, Christiane. The way that the press visit to this bomb site was orchestrated last night, it was very deliberately held back for two hours, and then we were taken there and then given a press conference here at the hotel, in which Moussa Ibrahim spelled out what he thought the attack meant does suggest that they will try and make as much political capital from this as they can.\n\nCertainly, it puts pressure on NATO and its allies. And we have seen already a very angry reaction from his supporters in Tripoli, reports of attacks on the U.S. embassy. i have spoken to U.N. officials today who say their offices were looted, also reports of attacks on the British and Italian missions here in Tripoli.\n\nThe unknowns, of course, are what Colonel Gadhafi's response will be. we have not heard from him yet. We do not know what the response of his supporters will be in the days ahead, and we do not know, really, what the sort of international reaction will be to what has unfolded here last night.\n\nAMANPOUR: A lot of questions there, Christian, and we will continue to monitor it.\n\nOf course, the U.S. embassy is empty, because all of the staff have been evacuated over the last several weeks and months. And now we go to the other side of this conflict and ABC's Miguel Marquez, who's in the east there in rebel-held Benghazi.\n\nMiguel, what is the reaction from the rebels? Do they think this attack could end the stalemate and signify a new -- a new impetus for them?\n\nMARQUEZ: Well, the rebels certainly are not buying this attack. They think that no one was killed in Tripoli last night. they are literally saying, Show us the bodies. They believe that this is a trick, another trick by Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, and they say that he is making this up simply to win that international support to divide the coalition. They simply want to see those bodies. Whether or not it will make a difference to this I think will depend on what Colonel Gadhafi and his troops do in the hours and days ahead -- Christiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: But, Miguel, is there any sense beyond this attack that the rebels are getting any more organized or getting any more weapons that they can actually take advantage of the help that NATO is giving them?\n\nMARQUEZ: there is a lot of winks and nods there. There are indications that the Qataris are arming up. Certainly, there is been some reporting on that front, but the rebels here are being very shy about it. There are reports that the Qataris are (OFF-MIKE) but we have not seen any evidence of that.\n\nThe other thing that the rebels say about this, that this (OFF- MIKE) you know, the Predator drones were a huge boost to them, and they believe that the U.S., they hope, will take even a greater role in leading operations here in Libya -- Christiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: Miguel, thank you so much.\n\nAnd later in the show, we will get an expert's take on whether this attack on Gadhafi will be a turning point in what is become a stalemate for the United States and its allies. But first, we turn to a different sort of battle being waged right here in the United States. It's a budget battle, of course, and this was the week Republican Congress members went home to defend their sweeping budget plan before their constituents. And the reception at one town hall after another was rocky.\n\nThe plan is the brain child of House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, who's feeling some of the heat himself. I traveled to Wisconsin to see how Ryan is weathering the storm.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: How are the crowds increasing and their levels of anxiety and frustration?\n\nRYAN: It's increasing, no two ways about it.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Congressman Ryan is at the center of the storm. It's his plan, of course, that has sparked the outcries. Across the country, the anger is palpable.\n\n(UNKNOWN): May I finish?\n\n(UNKNOWN): No.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(UNKNOWN): You went and gave away all those tax cuts.\n\nAMANPOUR: we have seen Republican congressmen fending off boos and catcalls from constituents over a plan to fundamentally overhaul two programs that millions of Americans have come to count on, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nRYAN: Hey, guys. How are you doing?\n\nAMANPOUR: With Congress in recess, Ryan is holding as many as four town meetings a day, and it's still not enough to keep up with demand from his constituents.\n\n(UNKNOWN): What I can do is I can give you a list of the other listening sessions we have scheduled today.\n\nRYAN: The crowds are really getting bigger, and people are getting much more anxious about just where the country's headed.\n\nAMANPOUR: This is the tail end of the marathon series of town halls for Ryan, who seems wholly unconcerned with the heat he's taking these days. Though the crowds we saw in Wisconsin were mostly friendly, some of his town meetings have been contentious.\n\n(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) trickle down.\n\nRYAN: We do (OFF-MIKE)\n\n(CROSSTALK) RYAN: It's a sign of the times, I think. I think it's a sign of anxiety of the times. It's also a sign of the misinformation that is been perpetrated out there.\n\nAMANPOUR (on-screen): Well, why do you say misinformation?\n\nRYAN: Well, there are TV, radio and phone calls that are running, trying to scare seniors. You know, the Democratic National Committee is running phone calls to seniors in my district, TV ads, saying we are hurting current seniors when, in fact, that is not the case. And so there is a lot of...\n\nAMANPOUR: is not that, though, par for the course?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: I mean, did not you lot do it the last time?\n\nRYAN: Yes, Republicans -- Republicans -- both parties do this to each other. And my whole point about that is, that is why we have this political paralysis.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): On the day we joined him, the gym at Franklin High School fills up well before the congressman arrives.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAMANPOUR: Ryan's presentation is earnest and, it must be said, wonky.\n\nRYAN: This pie chart shows you our federal government, basically its budget for last year.\n\nAMANPOUR: The most controversial aspect of Paul Ryan's budget plan would transform Medicare. He knows that could be political poison with seniors, and so he makes sure to remind those in the crowd the changes would not impact them.\n\nRYAN: How many of you are ## years of age or older? This budget does not affect your Medicare benefits.\n\nAMANPOUR: But for many, that leaves more questions than answers, especially since budget watchdogs estimate the Medicare revamp would cost people who are now under ## thousands of dollars out of pocket each year once their benefits kick in, and that has some here in Franklin very concerned.\n\n(UNKNOWN): ... because it's going to be a real burden for them, especially with the economy coming up. And I think about all of the ##-year-olds who have been unemployed. Where are they going to come up with this money in ## years to last their whole lifetime?\n\nAMANPOUR: Ryan argues delay is not an option.\n\nRYAN: Put these reforms in now, they do not take effect for ## years to give people time to prepare. If we keep kicking the can down the road and if we keep going trillions of dollars deeper in the hole, then the reforms are going to be sudden, urgent, and severe, and immediate, and people will not have -- that are going to catch them by surprise.\n\nAMANPOUR: Then the session ends...\n\nRYAN: I appreciate you coming out.\n\nAMANPOUR: ... and Congressman Ryan is off. I stayed back to speak with two of the women in the audience, Jackie (ph) and Lois (ph), each with very different perspectives on the congressman's plan.\n\n(UNKNOWN): I do not appreciate it at all, and that burns my potatoes. And I think it's not fair. And I think it's selfish and self-centered. you are worried about the seniors of today, and we have the seniors of tomorrow. We need to be worried about them, too. And there is a better way of fixing this plan, this problem that we did not get into, but we always got to be the ones.\n\nAMANPOUR (on-screen): Did you vote for Paul Ryan?\n\n(UNKNOWN): No. No.\n\nAMANPOUR: Did you?\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yes.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Lois says Ryan is trying to fix the problem before time and money run out.\n\n(on-screen): The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has said that the average senior will end up paying some $#,### more for their health care.\n\n(UNKNOWN): In ## years.\n\nAMANPOUR: Yes.\n\n(UNKNOWN): By ####, the whole plan Obama has is going to crash.\n\nRYAN: A few sentences later, CBO also said that the status quo of Medicare is unsustainable.\n\nAMANPOUR: Maybe, but it's going to shift a huge burden on to the elderly.\n\nRYAN: Right. But what the CBO also forgot to add is that we are giving an additional $#,### for low-income seniors on top of that. And I would argue -- and CBO concurs with this -- comparing any Medicare reform plan with the Medicare status quo is a fiscal fantasy. The Medicare status quo is not going be able to occur, because it's unsustainable.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): And Ryan dismisses any talk that tackling this thorny issue will cost Republicans at the polls.\n\n(on-screen): And now people are getting worried, people in your party. Perhaps they might think it might even cost them the election.\n\nRYAN: Sure. And I hear this all the time from the political people, from the pundits and the pollsters that this could be -- this could hurt us politically. I do not care about that. What I care about is fixing this country and getting this debt situation under control.\n\nLook, literally, Christiane, if all we fear about is our political careers, then we have no business having these jobs. If you want to good at these jobs, you have got to be willing to lose the job.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): Still, politically it's a delicate dance. Just listen to Speaker John Boehner discuss Ryan's plan in an interview with ABC's Jon Karl.\n\nBOEHNER: It's Paul's idea. Other people have other ideas. i am not wedded to one single idea.\n\nAMANPOUR (on-screen): How do you feel when Speaker Boehner tells ABC News that he's not wedded to your program, it's a good idea, it's one of many?\n\nRYAN: i have talked to John about this. It's an institutional statement reflecting budget resolutions. And what a budget resolution -- which is what we have passed -- it's the architecture of a budget.\n\nAMANPOUR: So you did not take it personally about...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: No, not at all. I did not take it personally. It's not -- it was not meant to be personal. I do not take it that way.\n\nAMANPOUR: Are you sure about that?\n\nRYAN: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, i have talked to him quite a bit about this.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): And with that, we arrive at our next stop.\n\nRYAN: Hey, folks. Nice to see you. Thank you very much.\n\nAMANPOUR: Some boos, but mostly cheers. The crowd is largely supportive.\n\n(UNKNOWN): And I'd like to thank you for being a bold person and standing up and saying, Listen, we cannot continue this way.\n\nAMANPOUR: Still, this man is angry that Ryan's plan refuses to consider raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans.\n\n(UNKNOWN): Borrow the money from the rich, fix the problem.\n\nRYAN: Look, I think a lot of people think this is sort of like the magic fairy dust of budgets, that we can just make a small amount of people pay some more taxes and it will fix all of our problems. Well, let's keep our eye on the ball. The eye on the ball is spending. And the sooner we get this thing under control, the better off everybody is going to be.\n\nAMANPOUR (on-screen): How do you feel about being the bogeyman in this whole budget business?\n\nRYAN: You know, I do not really think about it. I sleep well at night.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): At the end of the day, Congressman Ryan and I sit down to talk about the bottom line.\n\n(on-screen): People who have been studying your numbers very carefully and -- have been saying that the numbers do not add up.\n\nRYAN: Well, the Congressional Budget Office Says they do.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, it also says that two-thirds of the savings that you want to make in the spending cuts come at the expense of programs designed for the poor, for the disadvantaged, and this is reverse Robin Hood-ism, if you like, take from the poor, give back to the rich again.\n\nRYAN: Yeah, sure, i have heard that. Yeah, I would disagree with that. First of all, spending increases in this budget. Spending on the safety net increases, but it increases at a more sustainable rate. Here's the problem, Christiane. The safety net we have right now is going bankrupt. It's tearing apart at the seams.\n\nAMANPOUR: What you are proposing seems like it's going to put a lot of the burden on the seniors. they are worried that they are not going to be able to afford the cost of health insurance.\n\nRYAN: So we are saying give the most vulnerable people more money to cover their expenses and do not give wealthy people as much money to cover their expenses because they are wealthy and they should be able to afford more. But we are also saying is, you have got to get at the root cause of health inflation. Even President Obama is saying slow the growth rate of Medicare.\n\nAMANPOUR (voice-over): For now, the president and the congressman seem far apart. And as we crisscross his Wisconsin district, I ask Paul Ryan if some grand budget bargain could be in the offing.\n\n(on-screen): Do you think that these massive issues that you are dealing with, the budget, let's say, can be done only by one party?\n\nRYAN: No. No, I do not. I think it's going to have...\n\nAMANPOUR: So you have to negotiate?\n\nRYAN: Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.\n\nAMANPOUR: You have to work together? RYAN: Yes, I think so.\n\nAMANPOUR: Is that atmosphere available...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRYAN: No, not right now.\n\nAMANPOUR: It's not, is it?\n\nRYAN: Look, we are probably not going to get some grand-slam agreement that fixes all of these problems. My now hope is to get a single or a double, you know, to get something done that gets us on the right path.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nAMANPOUR: Congressman Ryan says that he expects Republicans and Democrats to agree on some fiscal controls to lock in spending levels, but he says a big-picture deal on the debt crisis probably will not happen before the #### election. And it's what the treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, said also on this program a couple of weeks ago.\n\nSo the big question remains: Can the United States afford to wait that long? Our powerhouse roundtable tackles that and weighs in with their reviews of the president's stand-up act, as well, at last night's White House correspondents' dinner.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Tonight, for the first time, I am releasing my official birth video.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLet's take a look.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: He's taken some flack lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald. And that is because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: A little light moment last night from the White House correspondents' dinner. President Obama taking a shot at Donald Trump. Funny stuff, and we will talk about it a little later.\n\nBut across the country, passions are running high on a more serious matter, a Republican debt reform plan that would slash spending and revamp Medicare and Medicaid without raising taxes on the wealthy. Has Paul Ryan laid the roadmap to victory for the Democrats? Or will his party have the last laugh?\n\nJoining me to answer that question, George Will, Arianna Huffington of the Huffington Post, Chrystia Freeland, global editor at Thomson Reuters, and David Stockman, who served as budget director under Ronald Reagan.\n\nThank you all for being here. Some of us were at that dinner last night, but, first, George, you heard what I asked Congressman Ryan, asking him about some of the Republicans who seem to be running now from the plan. Is this an election loser for them? Will they stick with him?\n\nWILL: they have clearly made a wager that this time the American people mean what they say about cutting government. His plan now for the budget is not the same as, but it's in the same general direction as the roadmap he proposed for entitlement reform and all the rest a few years ago (inaudible) pointing out the grand total of ## cosponsors. People are not eager to embrace it. He now has essentially made them embrace it by making the running.\n\nRepublicans are somewhat emboldened by the example of Marco Rubio running for the Senate in Florida in ####, when, in a state planted thick with seniors, the state known as God's antechamber, as a matter of fact, in the great state of Florida, he said we must raise the retirement age and perhaps, in some sense, means test Social Security. He said that volatile thing in that state and won in a landslide.\n\nHUFFINGTON: (OFF-MIKE) starting to listen to this incredibly shrinking budget debate where we are basically discussing what we are cutting without discussing what is happening in the country with jobs, basically, despite the fact that supposedly, you know, we have a reduction in unemployment. We know this is really a statistical reason because of the shrinking of the actual labor force, but not any real creation of jobs. And that is really what is so outstanding, that we are not focusing on this.\n\nAnd you go around the country, and there is this anxiety, this fear about kids graduating from college not being able to get jobs. The foreclosures are still rampant. Even Mitt Romney, you know, in New Hampshire actually took this on and sounded like a real populist, talking about the problems of people not being able to make ends meet.\n\nAMANPOUR: But what about the figures, the basic arithmetic? I mean, it is complex. You go to these town hall meetings, and the presentations are complex. And even people with vaguely conversant views on all of this find it difficult to understand. Is there a way to figure out what the actual math is without entering political and ideological debates? Is there a way to balance this budget, to reduce the debt, to get a hold of it without sort of hewing to very different political views?\n\nFREELAND: Well, I think it's always going to be a political debate, but what I think is really missing in both the Republican and the Democratic approach right now and is really an example of political cowardice is taxes.\n\nYou know, and we heard in your interview, Christiane, Ryan saying, well, you know, this is about cutting spending. It's partly going to be about cutting spending, but it is also going to be about raising taxes. And that is the thing that I think no one has the courage to talk about.\n\nAnd it's partly going to be -- I think there should be more taxes on the very rich. they are doing incredibly well in this economy. But it is also going to be about more taxes on the middle class, including consumption taxes.\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, that is interesting. I want to get to consumption taxes. But, David, Paul Ryan says that people see tax hikes as sort of a fairy dust that will solve everything. Is either party dealing with the tax issue in a way that could actually solve something?\n\nSTOCKMAN: No, I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long-run problem. The Ryan plan gets the balanced budget in ####, the fiscal hereafter. We have a here-and-now problem.\n\nThis debt that we are issuing every day, $# billion a day, is not being bought by real investors. It's being bought by the Fed and other central banks around the world, and they are going out of business in June. The Fed is stopping the bond-buying. QE# is over. The Chinese no longer need to buy, and the Japanese have their own problem.\n\nSo once we have to sell the debt to real investors, interest rates are going to start rising and the crisis will come immediately, in the next two or three years.\n\nNow, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing. He cuts $### billion or $### billion of spending, mostly from a small part of the budget, discretionary and the safety net, leaves Medicare totally untouched for # years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for ## years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next # years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we cannot afford.\n\nNow, that is getting nowhere. In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.\n\nFREELAND: Yeah, David, I have a question for you. You worked for Ronald Reagan. Do you think that America, the American economy -- so you are like a red-blooded capitalist -- could it sustain higher taxes than it has now?\n\nSTOCKMAN: Absolutely. In ####, we were looking at the jaws of the worst recession since the ####s. We overdid it in '##, cut taxes too much. We came back with the big deficit plan. In ####, unemployment's ## percent, the economy's in dire shape, and we raised taxes by #.# percent of GDP, which would be $### billion a year, right now, not ## years down the road, but right now. that is what we did in ####, because we still had people in government who realized you cannot simply be putting on this kind of debt into the world financial market.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, George, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is calling for a vote on this up or down. Is that -- what is that going to do? And do you think there is room for some kind of debate on a consumption tax, even though very few people want to do income?\n\nWILL: Oh, well, people of my persuasion will be all for it, considering a consumption tax, as soon as they repeal the ##th Amendment. Otherwise, they are going to pile a consumption tax, which is invisible to most people, on top of the income tax.\n\nLarry Summers, the departing economic adviser, said conservatives hate the consumption tax because they think it's a money machine for government and liberals do not like it because they think it's regressive. We will get a consumption tax when conservatives realize it's regressive and conservatives -- and liberals realize it's a money machine. It's not going to happen. The Senate has voted in a nonbinding resolution something like ##-## against the idea of a consumption tax.\n\nHUFFINGTON: You know, what is interesting is what Ryan is leaving out. You know, he's talking about reforming Medicare. He's not even allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to reduce drug costs. So he's not only addressing the major problem of drug costs rising, of health care costs rising.\n\nAnd also finally over the last week, he started talking about corporate welfare, about oil and gas subsidies, for example, but that is not part of his budget. So how can he be addressing seriously the budget deficit without addressing seriously corporate welfare?\n\nHe said, which also sounded interesting, that he does not want the government picking winners and losers. that is part of (inaudible) left and right debate. A lot of people across the political spectrum are saying that. Let's focus on this.\n\nAMANPOUR: He said to us that he is willing to talk about sort of getting rid of all those subsidies for oil companies and all those loopholes. Where do you think this is headed, though, in real economic fiscal terms? I mean, is there going to be some kind of deal on the very difficult issues?\n\nFREELAND: I thought that what you and Ryan had to say was right. I think that it's hard to see a real deal before the presidential election, and I think that David is right to point out that that could turn out to be quite tricky. And where we will really have the important market judgment is in June, when all this money that the Federal Reserve has been pumping into the economy and buying back, that is going to stop, and we are going to really see, how much is the world prepared to support the U.S. economy?\n\nAMANPOUR: All right. we will continue right after a break. And up next, President Obama releases his birth certificate and Donald Trump claims credit. More of that with our roundtable right after this.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: But i am speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness. we have got better stuff to do.\n\nTRUMP: Today, i am very proud of myself, because i have accomplished something that nobody else has been able to accomplish. Our president has finally released a birth certificate.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: President Obama and Donald Trump earlier this week. So have we seen the last of the birthers? Let's bring back our roundtable.\n\nHave we seen the last of this, George?\n\nWILL: Sure, I mean, to the extent that people are open to evidence. Now, there are some people in a nation of ### million people -- there are some people who are just cracked, and we are always going to have them out there.\n\nAMANPOUR: You know, you say cracked. On this program last week, we spoke with Reverend Franklin Graham, and he seemed to flirt with the idea of giving some credence to this and also supporting Donald Trump. And then when I asked him sort of, you know, why is it that this issue has been hijacked by the lunatic fringe and it's become such an issue? This is what I asked him, and listen to what he responded.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: you are a very important figure, and you have a big following, and you have a lot of authority. This business about the birth certificate, it really has been debunked over and over again. So I just want to know why somebody like you cannot just say, Enough already.\n\nGRAHAM: Oh, no, i am not -- you were asking me about Donald Trump...\n\nAMANPOUR: No, i am now talking about President Obama.\n\nGRAHAM: Oh, right. But it's Trump that has brought this up. i am not bringing up his birth certificate. i am just saying, it looks like, for the critics out there, his critics -- and i am not one of them -- his critics, it looks like he could shut their mouths pretty quickly by coming up with a little bit more than what he's come up with.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nAMANPOUR: So he has come up, and you are shaking your head, Chrystia.\n\nFREELAND: I think it's obvious that it's just going to move on to new things. And we have already seen Donald Trump talking about, well, you know, maybe his college -- maybe his college documents are not exactly right.\n\nI mean, I think that there is something behind all of this that enough people are not talking about and that the president actually rather recently hinted at in his speech last night, with the Lion King stuff and then saying, you know, Michele Bachmann, maybe she was born in Canada. There is a racial element here. And I think that part of the whole birther movement is about finding a way that is not overtly racist to say, is he really American? You know, can this black guy really be an American?\n\nSTOCKMAN: I do not think it's so much racism. I think it's Washington has succumb to theater and has lost the point that it should be about governance. And one of the reasons for that is that the Fed has enabled Washington to run massive deficits year after year after year and issue all of these bonds and get away with it.\n\nAnd so, therefore, since they are not worried, since they do not fear the consequence of what they are doing, they are willing to engage in this kind of, you know, rank theater, when, so to speak, Rome is burning.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTOCKMAN: And one of these days we are going to have a rude awakening, and I believe it's coming soon.\n\nAMANPOUR: So...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHUFFINGTON: But this is also something that is always happened in times of deep economic anxiety. Paranoid politics can thrive, and demagoguery can thrive, and people can believe things for which there is no evidence.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, clearly, people have believed things for which there is no evidence, but, George, what does this mean now for the Republican field? I mean, is Donald Trump a serious candidate or has he been deflated, given the fact that Haley Barbour, governor of Mississippi, has stepped out? Where does the Republican field look like it is right now?\n\nWILL: The Republican field is perfectly fine. They lost in Haley Barbour a plausible president, and they lost it because he understands the Broder rule. The late David Broder said anyone who will do what you have to do to become president should not be allowed to be president. And he said this requires a ##-year commitment; i am not prepared to make it. that is not a moral failing. In some people, it's a sign of maturity. You have Romney, Pawlenty, perhaps Mitch Daniels -- I do not -- who am I leaving out?\n\nFREELAND: Huckabee.\n\nHUFFINGTON: Huntsman.\n\nWILL: Huntsman.\n\nFREELAND: is not this a good moment for Huckabee now?\n\nWILL: It might be, but the fact is, we are actually fairly far along in this process. we have winnowed the field already. We know basically who the choice is going to be. The Republicans have to simply nominate someone who is a plausible president and then it becomes a referendum on Mr. Obama.\n\nHUFFINGTON: But, actually, George has a point here. And Seth Meyers last night in a way made that point when he said the one person who can really beat you, Mr. President, is Obama '##, and do not you miss him, effectively? What happened to him?\n\nAnd I was talking to a hard-core Democrat after the dinner who said to me that Obama is gone. He said he's not coming back. We just have to win. So this is what is happened, and it's a interesting dynamic. You know, hard-core Democrats are just about winning, but the problem for the White House is all the first-time voters who came out in large numbers and really got him to the White House in '##. Are they coming back? Because they are not just about winning. They were inspired. And that was the other thing that Seth Meyers said yesterday. What is will.i.am going to do this year? Is he going to find something to rhyme with debt ceiling? that is a big problem for...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAMANPOUR: Well, talking to that, what is the correct or the winnable economic strategy to be taking going into this election? Obviously -- and you have all been saying it -- it is about jobs. And I think you have been saying that all of this is obscuring the necessity to figure out jobs.\n\nFREELAND: Well, I think especially for a Democrat, which the president is, i have been surprised that they have not pushed much more on that. Maybe they are worried that they do not have a very strong jobs record, but I think that they really are letting the Republicans set the terms of the debate, and the debate right now is about cutting spending, maybe raising taxes. I think that a smart Democratic strategy would be to come out and say, I am the guy who is going to focus on middle-class jobs. I care about that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTOCKMAN: No, I think the right strategy is to focus on the engine of destruction in our economy today, which is the Fed. The Fed is savaging Main Street, with zero earnings -- interest on their savings, with this massive inflation we have now in food and fuel. At the same time, it is fueling the greatest bubble that we have seen yet, even bigger than housing. It's all going to a few thousand people on Wall Street.\n\nFREELAND: But, David, come on...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTOCKMAN: Now, that has to stop...\n\nAMANPOUR: On that note...\n\nSTOCKMAN: ... and he could stop that. And yet what did he do? He reappointed the same guy who brought you the problem that elected him in ####.\n\nAMANPOUR: you are going to discuss this further in the Green Room. And up next, we go live to Rome, where this morning the Catholic Church puts Pope John Paul II one step closer to sainthood.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: Welcome back. We told you at the top of this program that a NATO air strike hit a building with Moammar Gadhafi inside in Libya. Reportedly it just missed him, but killed his youngest son and three grandchildren.\n\nAnd it's been a costly week across the Middle East, including for the United States servicemembers, nine of whom were murdered by an Afghan pilot right there near Kabul.\n\nJoining me to talk about it all is Vali Nasr, who until very recently was a senior adviser to the State Department on the Middle East and Afghanistan, and Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson International Center, who also used to be a Middle East peace adviser to various administrations.\n\nGentlemen, thank you both very much for joining me.\n\nMILLER: A pleasure.\n\nNASR: Thank you.\n\nAMANPOUR: So this is a big day, and people are wondering whether this is going to be a turning point, this attack in Tripoli, very close to the Gadhafi stronghold, and apparently killing one of his sons. Vali, what does this mean as the U.S. policy seems to be in a stalemate?\n\nNASR: Well, aside from the diplomatic issues that it raises, it's now very clear that the narrative is rapidly changing, that this democracy wave is not self-sustaining anymore. It's increasingly coming upon the United States or the pressure is on the United States to push it to the next stage. And that could be a tall order. It could be expensive. It could be messy. And we need to sort of step back and think about how we tackle this new challenge.\n\nAMANPOUR: So, in Libya, you say the narrative is changing. Is it saying it's a war without end? Is it -- what is it saying there?\n\nNASR: Well, it has been a war without end, but now it's also coming down -- at least the narrative that is going to be seen is coming down to literally having to remove Gadhafi out of the scene. And if NATO is going after him, it is essentially sending a signal out that democracy is not going to succeed, that the rebels are not going to succeed unless we go in and remove the leadership. And that obviously is a whole new order of business with this issue.\n\nAMANPOUR: So potentially removing the leadership, if it comes to that, what about in Syria, where you have worked very closely on those issues for Republican and Democratic administration? People are looking at that. It's been a very bloody week in Syria, and yet no sort of idea that Bashar Assad, the president, should be removed.\n\nMILLER: It's because great powers are allowed and do behave hypocritically and inconsistently. And the reality is, Libya was easy. It was vulnerable. No serious air defense system. No serious allies. We could get away with and did military intervention. Syria's quite different.\n\nAnd, number two, you do not have a fundamentally divided country. You do not have Syrias right now. You have repression. And you have Bashar Assad mobilizing the instruments of power in order to stay in power. I think the arc on the Assads over time is a negative one, and I think they are an old story, but it's going to take a long time for this movie to play out.\n\nAMANPOUR: The movie is being very closely watched by many people in the United States and around the world. People are always coming up to me and asking me, what does this all mean for us, what happened in Tunisia, what happened in Egypt?\n\nPeople thought Egypt was a democratic revolution, which presumably it still has an opportunity to be, but the latest Pew polls give some worrying figures for the United States, basically saying about Egypt that ## percent of Egyptians now disapprove of how President Obama is dealing with the calls for political change in their own nation, Egypt, elsewhere, Tunisia, Bahrain, and Libya. And then their view of the United States, ## percent unfavorable, ## percent favorable. Vali, how can this be? People hoped that a democratic Middle East would actually have a better view of the United States.\n\nNASR: Well, first of all, we are not at a democracy in the Middle East. All that we have achieved is that in Tunisia and Egypt, which were the easy cases, the leadership has gone. there is still a long distance between the old order going and actually arriving at democracy. And there is also a very short distance in these kinds of situations between euphoria and disenchantment.\n\nAnd finally, the fundamental issues that divided the people of the Middle East from the United States have not gone away. The Middle East has been busy with other issues recently, but when the dust settles, the critical issues of the Arab-Israeli peace process, this whole issue between Islam and the West, Iran, you know, all of these issues, Al Qaida, are still there. And nothing has happened to close the gap between our perception of those issues and the people's perception of those issues in the Muslim world.\n\nAMANPOUR: i am going to get to the Middle East peace process in two seconds, but I just want to ask you further, the foreign policy of Egypt looks like they are going closer to their traditional adversaries -- let's say Iran, let's say Hamas -- people who are sort of -- definitely adversaries of the United States, as well. How is this going to work out? And why is that?\n\nNASR: Well, because for the longest time our foreign policy in the Middle East was based on the support of the palaces, who really did not need to deal with the street and the people in the Middle East. It's the Mubaraks and Ben Alis and, you know, kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan that made decisions that we work with. Now we have to deal with countries that are reflecting the public opinion of their masses.\n\nAMANPOUR: Of the street. It's the famous Arab street.\n\nNASR: Arab street. And until such day where there is some common ground between our street and their street, we are going to have this disjunction. It's possible, for instance, on the issue of Al Qaida that we can -- there can be some sense of common interest between Americans and the people of the Middle East. But on issues of Arab-Israeli issue, on Iran, and on a number of other issues, the gap is still too wide, and we are going to see that opinion of the region is going to get reflected in the foreign policy.\n\nAMANPOUR: And now, on the Middle East, people also are now asking about the development this week, the rapprochement between the Palestinian Authority, supported by the United States, and Hamas, which the U.S. and Israel say is a terrorist organization. What does that mean for the peace process? And is there one?\n\nMILLER: It's not even noon and i am already depressed talking about focusing on this issue. I mean, Vali's point is a good one. And before the Middle East issue, our street cred is way down. we are neither admired, feared or respected as much as we need to be, given the fundamental nature and vital interests that we have in this region.\n\nwe are involved in three wars where the standard for victory is not can we win, but when can we leave? We are responding in a very difficult -- and it's understandable way to both the Arab spring in Egypt and Tunisia and the Arab winter in Bahrain, in Yemen, and in Syria. So our prestige and power...\n\nAMANPOUR: It's events-driven.\n\nMILLER: For sure. Our prestige and power is way down. And what history teaches us is when, in fact, the United States presides over breakthroughs on this other issue, the problem of the much too promised land, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, our street cred was actually up. We demonstrated both in warmaking and peacemaking -- Kissinger, Carter and Baker, the three -- that we could actually succeed. Right now, we are stuck. we are stuck in a region we cannot fix and we are stuck in a region from which we cannot extricate ourselves. Bad news for the great power.\n\nAMANPOUR: It sounds pretty bad news the way you are saying it. And I wanted to ask you -- there was an article in the New Yorker this week which quoted an administration official as saying that the policy right now was lead from behind. What does that mean, lead from behind?\n\nNASR: Well, I do not know the exact context in which that...\n\nAMANPOUR: Talking about Libya and elsewhere.\n\nNASR: Elsewhere. But the real issue for us is this, is that we have a disjuncture between our means and our goals in the region. we are not dealing with events in only one country. we are dealing with events over a vast region that may be unfolding over a number of years, and we have to find a way to have a sustainable policy.\n\nAnd therefore, if we push too hard, if we remove governments, then much has happened in Iraq or Afghanistan. we are going to own it afterwards. We have to do the state building, which has not been easy or cheap for us. And therefore, there is a sense that we need to calibrate.\n\nAMANPOUR: So is right now the net positive for the United States -- the net result positive, or negative, or is the jury still out in the Middle East in that region?\n\nNASR: I think the jury is still out, because many people assume that this will be a short-run, very quick, very painless set of events that will end up with a much better Middle East after that. Now we are looking at a multi-year process that does not have a very clear end. And if anybody thought that we will be done with the Middle East quickly and we are going to go to China and India, we are going to be busy with this issue for some time.\n\nAMANPOUR: Gentlemen, thank you both very much, indeed.\n\nStay with us. we are live next from the Vatican where thousands are celebrating as Pope John Paul II takes one step closer to sainthood. That just after a short break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: We were just speaking about the Arab spring. And well before that uprising, there was the fall of the Iron Curtain, ending communism in Eastern Europe. And that, of course, was back in ####. It was a cause dear to Pope John Paul II.\n\nAnd this was the scene at the Vatican, St. Peter's Square, this morning, where hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are on hand as John Paul moves one big step closer to sainthood. Our David Wright is there right now.\n\nDavid?\n\nWRIGHT: Good morning, Christiane.\n\nYou know, the last time all of these people were gathered here to honor Pope John Paul was, of course, at his funeral six years ago. And you remember then, they were all chanting, Santo subito, Sainthood now. Well, today's event is a partial fulfillment of that demand. He's not a saint yet, but he has moved a lot closer.\n\nAnd consider: This church took ### years to beatify Joan of Arc, so for John Paul II, six years is pretty subito.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWRIGHT (voice-over): Six years have passed since the faithful last gathered in St. Peter's Square to honor Pope John Paul, six years since his coffin was closed and placed in the crypt beneath the basilica, but workers have reverently removed it from its marble tomb. And with cardinals as the foremen, they placed it in front of the Tomb of St. Peter.\n\nToday, the closed casket is at the main altar, where John Paul lay in state six years ago. Pope Benedict and the cardinals were the first to pay their respects.\n\nIn life, he was a towering figure, not just for the church, but on the world stage. In death, there have been questions about his stewardship of an institution rocked by internal divisions and by scandal.\n\nHe inspired the revolution that ultimately forced the collapse of communism. Shortly after his election, the young pope famously exhorted his fellow Poles, do not be afraid. He gave them the courage to rise up, said Lech Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, the Polish workers first to challenge communist authority.\n\nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev later said that the collapse of the Iron Curtain would have been impossible without John Paul, but he also had plenty of detractors because of his handling of the massive church abuse scandal that happened on his watch.\n\nWAUCK: The people who are shouting Santo subito, as far as I can tell, are still shouting, Santo subito.\n\nWRIGHT (on-screen): But there are some people who are saying, Hold the halo.\n\nWAUCK: The same people who are saying Hold the halo now I think were the people who would have been saying it five years ago.\n\nWRIGHT (voice-over): His name will forever be blessed, Pope Benedict proclaimed at today's beatification mass. At that moment, an enormous tapestry unfurled. Blessed Pope John Paul is now well on his way to sainthood.\n\nWILLIAMS: In practical terms, to declare a person blessed or beatified means that they are in heaven. It's really just a statement by the church. It's a recognition of heroic virtue, of a life of sanctity, of holiness, and that this person is with God.\n\nWRIGHT: Investigators have pored over his life for the past five years looking not just at his promotion of world peace, but also at the moral example he set in public and private. For instance, after that assassination attempt in ####, Pope John Paul was critically wounded. Later, he sat down with the man who shot him and offered forgiveness. WAUCK: One of the most heroic acts of virtue that exists is forgiveness. And to forgive someone who tried to kill you -- and almost did -- I mean, it does not get much more powerful than that.\n\nWRIGHT: Under the Vatican process, heroic virtues are not enough.\n\nSARNO: For beatification and canonization, the church requires a physical miracle, a healing or some physical reality that can be measured.\n\nWRIGHT: This French nun says she was cured of Parkinson's disease after she and members of her convent prayed to the late pope. At today's mass, Sister Marie Simon-Pierre carried a relic of John Paul, a vial of his blood extracted during his long illness.\n\nBut there are also detractors.\n\n(on-screen): So you are not a big fan of Santo subito in this case?\n\nLYNAUGH: No, I have deep reservations.\n\nWRIGHT (voice-over): Joe Lynaugh is one of many Catholics who say the speed of John Paul's fast-tracked sainthood is an insult to the victims of sexual abuse.\n\nLYNAUGH: I guarantee you that the argument will be made that these issues have been settled or have been almost settled because we have beatified John Paul.\n\nWRIGHT: Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., insists the scandal did not diminish John Paul's obvious sanctity.\n\n(on-screen): At the same time, there is a groundswell of people that are saying, Not so subito.\n\nWUERL: Everybody on this planet recognized that this man, John Paul, was a man of God. He had a close relationship with God. And the church is simply recognizing officially what everybody in their hearts knows.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWRIGHT: People have been pointing out that the fast track to sainthood is really one of the more democratic things in an institution that is almost definitively top down. Keep in mind it was not the bishops and the cardinals chanting Santo subito. It was the people, and the church today is partially ratifying that wish. And now all that remains is another miracle, and people here are praying and waiting for that before John Paul gets declared a saint.\n\nChristiane?\n\nAMANPOUR: Thanks, David, there in Rome. And we will have more in a moment. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAMANPOUR: It's been a costly week in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Pentagon has released the names of ## servicemembers killed in the past week.\n\nthat is it for our program. Join me to continue the conversation on Twitter and on abcnews.com, and be sure to tune in for World News Tonight for a full report on the day in Rome, as well as the latest from Libya. We leave you now with the scene in St. Peter's Square today, as the late Pope John Paul II was beatified, bringing him, as we say, one step closer to sainthood.\n\nSo for all of us here at This Week, thank you for watching, and we hope to see you again next week."

    "text": "#:## P.M. MDT\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, El Paso! (Applause.) Well, it is wonderful -- wonderful to be back with all of you in the Lone Star State. (Applause.) Everything is bigger in Texas. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I love you back! (Applause.) Even the welcomes are bigger. (Applause.) So, in appreciation, I wanted to give a big policy speech outside on a really hot day. (Laughter.) Those of you who are still wearing your jackets, feel free to take them off. I hope everybody is wearing sunscreen.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We live here.\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You say you live here? You don\u2019t need it, huh? (Laughter.) Well, it is a great honor to be here. And I want to express my appreciation to all of you for taking the time to come out today.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nYou know, about a week ago, I delivered a commencement address at Miami Dade Community College, which is one of the most diverse schools in the nation. The graduates were proud that their class could claim heritage from ### countries around the world -- ### countries. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nMany of the students were immigrants themselves, coming to America with little more than the dream of their parents and the clothes on their back. A handful had discovered only in adolescence or adulthood that they were undocumented. But they worked hard and they gave it their all, and so they earned those diplomas.\n\n\n\nAnd at the ceremony, ### flags -- one for every nation that was represented -- was marched across the stage. And each one was applauded by the graduates and the relatives with ties to those countries. So when the Haitian flag went by, all the Haitian kids -- Haitian American kids shouted out. And when the Guatemalan flag went by, all the kids of Guatemalan heritage shouted out. And when the Ukrainian flag went by, I think one kid shouted out. (Laughter.) This was down in Miami. (Laughter.) If it had been in Chicago, there would have been more.\n\n\n\nBut then, the last flag, the American flag, came into view. And everyone in the room erupted in applause. Everybody cheered. (Applause.) So, yes, their parents and grandparents -- some of the graduates themselves -- had come from every corner of the globe. But it was here that they had found opportunity. It was here that they had a chance to contribute to the nation that is their home.\n\n\n\nAnd it was a reminder of a simple idea, as old as America itself: E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants -- a nation that welcomes those willing to embrace America\u2019s ideals and America\u2019s precepts. That\u2019s why millions of people, ancestors to most of us, braved hardship and great risk to come here -- so they could be free to work and worship and start a business and live their lives in peace and prosperity. The Asian immigrants who made their way to California\u2019s Angel Island. The German and Scandinavians who settled across the Midwest. The waves of Irish, and Italian, and Polish, and Russian, and Jewish immigrants who leaned against the railing to catch their first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty.\n\n\n\nThis flow of immigrants has helped make this country stronger and more prosperous. (Applause.) We can point to the genius of Einstein, the designs of I. M. Pei, the stories of Isaac Asimov, the entire industries that were forged by Andrew Carnegie.\n\n\n\nAnd then when I think about immigration I think about the naturalization ceremonies that we\u2019ve held at the White House for members of our military. Nothing could be more inspiring. Even though they were not yet citizens when they joined our military, these men and women signed up to serve.\n\n\n\nWe did one event at the White House and a young man named Granger Michael from Papua New Guinea, a Marine who had been deployed to Iraq three times, was there. And you know what he said about becoming an American citizen? He said, \u201cI might as well. I love this country already.\u201d That\u2019s all he said. Marines aren\u2019t big on speeches. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nAnother was a woman named Perla Ramos who was born and raised in Mexico and came to the United States shortly after #/##, and joined the Navy. And she said, \u201cI take pride in our flag and the history we write day by day.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the promise of this country -- that anyone can write the next chapter in our story. It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from -- (applause) -- it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from; it doesn\u2019t matter what you look like; it doesn\u2019t matter what faith you worship. What matters is that you believe in the ideals on which we were founded; that you believe that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. (Applause.) All of us deserve our freedoms and our pursuit of happiness. In embracing America, you can become American. That is what makes this country great. That enriches all of us.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, at the same time, we\u2019re here at the border today -- (applause) -- we\u2019re here at the border because we also recognize that being a nation of laws goes hand in hand with being a nation of immigrants. This, too, is our heritage. This, too, is important. And the truth is, we\u2019ve often wrestled with the politics of who is and who isn\u2019t allowed to come into this country. This debate is not new.\n\n\n\nAt times, there has been fear and resentment directed towards newcomers, especially in hard economic times. And because these issues touch deeply on what we believe, touch deeply on our convictions -- about who we are as a people, about what it means to be an American -- these debates often elicit strong emotions.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s one reason it\u2019s been so difficult to reform our broken immigration system. When an issue is this complex, when it raises such strong feelings, it\u2019s easier for politicians to defer until the problem the next election. And there\u2019s always a next election.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve seen a lot of blame and a lot of politics and a lot of ugly rhetoric around immigration. And we\u2019ve seen good faith efforts from leaders of both parties -- by the way, I just noticed, those of you who have chairs, if you want to sit down, feel free. There\u2019s no rule about having to stand when I\u2019m --\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: -- we love you! (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: But we\u2019ve seen leaders of both parties who try to work on this issue, but then their efforts fell prey to the usual Washington games. And all the while, we\u2019ve seen the mounting consequences of decades of inaction.\n\n\n\nToday, there are an estimated ## million undocumented immigrants here in the United States. Some crossed the border illegally. Others avoid immigration laws by overstaying their visas. Regardless of how they came, the overwhelming majority of these folks are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBut we have to acknowledge they\u2019ve broken the rules. They\u2019ve cut in front of the line. And what is also true is that the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are trying to immigrate legally.\n\n\n\nAlso, because undocumented immigrants live in the shadows, where they\u2019re vulnerable to unscrupulous businesses that skirt taxes, and pay workers less than the minimum wage, or cut corners with health and safety laws, this puts companies who follow the rules, and Americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime or just a safe place to work, it puts those businesses at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\nThink about it. Over the past decade, even before the recession hit, middle-class families were struggling to get by as the costs went up for everything, from health care, to college tuition, to groceries, to gas. Their incomes didn\u2019t go up with those prices. We\u2019re seeing it again right now with gas prices.\n\n\n\nSo one way to strengthen the middle class in America is to reform the immigration system so that there is no longer a massive underground economy that exploits a cheap source of labor while depressing wages for everybody else. I want incomes for middle-class families to rise again. (Applause.) I want prosperity in this country to be widely shared. (Applause.) I want everybody to be able to reach that American dream. And that\u2019s why immigration reform is an economic imperative. It\u2019s an economic imperative. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd reform will also help to make America more competitive in the global economy. Today, we provide students from around the world with visas to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBut then our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or a new industry here in the United States. Instead of training entrepreneurs to stay here, we train them to create jobs for our competition. That makes no sense. In a global marketplace, we need all the talent we can attract, all the talent we can get to stay here to start businesses -- not just to benefit those individuals, but because their contribution will benefit all Americans.\n\n\n\nLook at Intel, look at Google, look at Yahoo, look at eBay. All those great American companies, all the jobs they\u2019ve created, everything that has helped us take leadership in the high-tech industry, every one of those was founded by, guess who, an immigrant. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo we don\u2019t want the next Intel or the next Google to be created in China or India. We want those companies and jobs to take root here. (Applause.) Bill Gates gets this. He knows a little something about the high-tech industry. He said, \u201cThe United States will find it far more difficult to maintain its competitive edge if it excludes those who are able and willing to help us compete.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo immigration is not just the right thing to do. It\u2019s smart for our economy. It\u2019s smart for our economy. (Applause.) And it\u2019s for this reason that businesses all across America are demanding that Washington finally meet its responsibilities to solve the immigration problem. Everybody recognizes the system is broken. The question is, will we finally summon the political will to do something about it? And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here at the border today.\n\n\n\nAnd I want to say I am joined today by an outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who\u2019s been working tirelessly on this issue. (Applause.) Our commissioner who\u2019s working diligently on border issues, Alan Bersin, is there, and we appreciate him -- Bersin. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo they\u2019re doing outstanding work. And in recent years, among one of the greatest impediments to reform were questions about border security. And these were legitimate concerns. What was true was a lack of manpower and a lack of resources at the border, combined with the pull of jobs and ill-considered enforcement once folks were in the country.\n\n\n\nAll this contributed to a growing number of undocumented people living in the United States. And these concerns helped unravel a bipartisan coalition that we had forged back when I was in the United States Senate. So in the years since, \u201cborders first, borders first,\u201d that is become the common refrain, even among those who were previously supportive of comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n\n\nBut over the last two years, thanks to the outstanding work of Janet and Alan and everybody who\u2019s down here working at the border, we\u2019ve answered those concerns. Under their leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible. They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThe Border Patrol has ##,### agents -- more than twice as many as there were in ####. It\u2019s a build-up that began under President Bush and that we\u2019ve continued, and I had a chance to meet some of these outstanding agents, and actually saw some of them on horseback who looked pretty tough. (Laughter.) So we put the agents here.\n\n\n\nThen they wanted a fence. Well, the fence is --\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The fence is now basically complete.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Tear it down!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Then we\u2019ve gone further. We tripled the number of intelligence analysts working at the border. I\u2019ve deployed unmanned aerial vehicles to patrol the skies from Texas to California. We have forged a partnership with Mexico to fight the transnational criminal organizations that have affected both of our countries. (Applause.) And for the first time -- for the first time we\u2019re screening ### percent of southbound rail shipments to seize guns and money going south even as we go after drugs that are coming north. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo, here\u2019s the point. I want everybody to listen carefully to this. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we\u2019ve done. But even though we\u2019ve answered these concerns, I\u2019ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: They\u2019re racist!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now they\u2019re going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or they\u2019ll want a higher fence. Maybe they\u2019ll need a moat. (Laughter.) Maybe they want alligators in the moat. (Laughter.) They\u2019ll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That\u2019s politics.\n\n\n\nBut the truth is the measures we\u2019ve put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, we\u2019ve seized ## percent more drugs, ## percent more currency, ## percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly ## percent from two years ago. That means far fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally.\n\n\n\nAnd also, despite a lot of breathless reports that have tagged places like El Paso as dangerous, violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. (Applause.) Of course, we shouldn\u2019t accept any violence or crime. And we\u2019ve always got more work to do. But this progress is important and it\u2019s not getting reported on.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re also going beyond the border. Beyond the border, we\u2019re going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law. (Applause.) And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that\u2019s a tough issue. It\u2019s a source of controversy.\n\n\n\nBut I want to emphasize we\u2019re not doing it haphazardly. We\u2019re focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we\u2019ve increased the removal of criminals by ## percent. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to ignore the real human toll of a broken immigration system. Even as we recognize that enforcing the law is necessary, we don\u2019t relish the pain that it causes in the lives of people who are just trying to get by and get caught up in the system.\n\n\n\nAnd as long as the current laws are on the books, it\u2019s not just hardened felons who are subject to removal, but sometimes families who are just trying to earn a living, or bright, eager students, or decent people with the best of intentions. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that\u2019s not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. that is what I\u2019m committed to doing. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, we can. We can do it. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The most significant step we can now take to secure the borders is to fix the system as a whole so that fewer people have the incentive to enter illegally in search of work in the first place. This would allow agents to focus on the worst threats on both of our -- both sides of our borders, from drug traffickers to those who would come here to commit acts of violence or terror. That\u2019s where our focus should be.\n\n\n\nSo, El Paso, the question is whether those in Congress who previously walked away in the name of enforcement are now ready to come back to the table and finish the work that we\u2019ve started. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to put the politics aside. And if we do, I\u2019m confident we can find common ground.\n\n\n\nWashington is lagging behind the country on this. There is already a growing coalition of leaders across America who don\u2019t always see eye-to-eye, but are coming together on this issue. They see the harmful consequences of a broken immigration system for their businesses and for their communities, and they understand why we need to act.\n\n\n\nThere are Democrats and Republicans, people like former Republican Senator Mel Martinez; former Bush administration Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; leaders like Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; evangelical ministers like Leith Anderson and Bill Hybels; police chiefs from across the nation; educators; advocates; labor unions; chambers of commerce; small business owners; Fortune ### CEOs.\n\n\n\nI mean, one CEO had this to say about reform: \u201cAmerican ingenuity is a product of the openness and diversity of this society. Immigrants have made America great as the world leader in business, in science, higher education and innovation.\u201d You know who that leader was? Rupert Murdoch, who owns FOX News, and is an immigrant himself. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s views, but let\u2019s just say he doesn\u2019t have an Obama sticker on his car. (Laughter.) But he agrees with me on this. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo there is a consensus around fixing what\u2019s broken. And now we need Congress to catch up. Now we need to come together around reform that reflects our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants; reform that demands that everybody take responsibility. So what would comprehensive reform look like?\n\n\n\nFirst, we know that government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders and enforce the law. And that\u2019s what Janet and all her folks are doing. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSecond, businesses have to be held accountable if they exploit undocumented workers. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThird, those who are here illegally, they have a responsibility as well. So they broke the law, and that means they\u2019ve got to pay their taxes, they\u2019ve got to pay a fine, they\u2019ve got to learn English. And they\u2019ve got to undergo background checks and a lengthy process before they get in line for legalization. That\u2019s not too much to ask. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd fourth, stopping illegal immigration also depends on reforming our outdated system of legal immigration. (Applause.) We should make it easier for the best and the brightest to not only stay here, but also to start businesses and create jobs here. In recent years, a full ## percent of high-tech startups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants. That led to ###,### jobs here in America. I\u2019m glad those jobs are here. I want to see more of them created in this country. We need to provide them the chance. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe need to provide our farms a legal way to hire workers that they rely on, and a path for those workers to earn legal status. (Applause.) And our laws should respect families following the rules -- reuniting them more quickly instead of splitting them apart. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nToday, the immigration system not only tolerates those who break the rules, but it punishes folks who follow the rules. While applications -- while applicants wait for approval, for example, they\u2019re often forbidden from visiting the United States. Even husbands and wives may have to spend years apart. Parents can\u2019t see their children. I don\u2019t believe the United States of America should be in the business of separating families. That\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not who we are. We can do better than that. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents. (Applause.) We should stop denying them the chance to earn an education or serve in the military. And that\u2019s why we need to pass the DREAM Act. (Applause.) Now, we passed the DREAM Act through the House last year when Democrats were in control. But even though it received a majority of votes in the Senate, it was blocked when several Republicans who had previously supported the DREAM Act voted no.\n\n\n\nThat was a tremendous disappointment to get so close and then see politics get in the way. And as I gave that commencement at Miami Dade, it broke my heart knowing that a number of those promising, bright students -- young people who worked so hard and who speak about what\u2019s best in America -- are at risk of facing the agony of deportation. These are kids who grew up in this country. They love this country. They know no other place to call home. The idea that we\u2019d punish them is cruel. It makes no sense. We\u2019re a better nation than that. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019re going to keep fighting for the DREAM Act. We\u2019re going to keep up the fight for reform. (Applause.) And that\u2019s where you come in. I\u2019m going to do my part to lead a constructive and civil debate on these issues. And we\u2019ve already had a series of meetings about this at the White House in recent weeks. We\u2019ve got leaders here and around the country helping to move the debate forward.\n\n\n\nBut this change ultimately has to be driven by you, the American people. You\u2019ve got to help push for comprehensive reform, and you\u2019ve got to identify what steps we can take right now -- like the DREAM Act, like visa reform -- areas where we can find common ground among Democrats and Republicans and begin to fix what\u2019s broken.\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m asking you to add your voices to this debate. You can sign up to help at whitehouse.gov. We need Washington to know that there is a movement for reform that\u2019s gathering strength from coast to coast. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll get this done. That\u2019s how we can ensure that in the years ahead we are welcoming the talents of all who can contribute to this country and that we\u2019re living up to the basic American idea that you can make it here if you try. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the idea that gave hope to Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez. Is Jos\u00e9 here? Where\u2019s -- Jos\u00e9 is right over there. (Applause.) I want you to hear -- I want you to think about this story. Jos\u00e9\u2019s parents were migrant farm workers. And so, growing up, he was too. He was born in California, though he could have just as easily been born on the other side of the border, if it had been a different time of year, because his family moved around with the seasons. So two of his siblings were actually born in Mexico.\n\n\n\nSo they traveled a lot, and Jos\u00e9 joined his parents picking cucumbers and strawberries. And he missed part of school when they returned to Mexico each winter. Jos\u00e9 didn\u2019t learn English until he was ## years old. But you know what, Jos\u00e9 was good at math and he liked math. And the nice thing is that math was the same in every school, and it\u2019s the same in Spanish as it is in English.\n\n\n\nSo Jos\u00e9 studied, and he studied hard. And one day, he\u2019s standing in the fields, collecting sugar beets, and he heard on a transistor radio that a man named Franklin Chang-Diaz -- a man with a surname like his -- was going to be an astronaut for NASA. So Jos\u00e9 decided -- right there in the field, he decided -- well, I could be an astronaut, too.\n\n\n\nSo Jos\u00e9 kept on studying, and he graduated high school. And he kept on studying, and he earned an engineering degree. And he kept on studying, and he earned a graduate degree. And he kept on working hard, and he ended up at a national laboratory, helping to develop a new kind of digital medical imaging system.\n\n\n\nAnd a few years later, he found himself more than ### miles above the surface of the Earth, staring out of the window of the shuttle Discovery, and he was remembering the boy in the California fields with that crazy dream that in America everything is possible. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThink about that, El Paso. That\u2019s the American Dream right there. (Applause.) that is what we\u2019re fighting for. We are fighting for every boy and every girl like Jos\u00e9 with a dream and potential that is just waiting to be tapped. We are fighting to unlock that promise, and all that holds not just for their futures, but for America\u2019s future. that is why we\u2019re going to get this done. And that is why I\u2019m going to need your help.\n\n\n\nThank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n#:## P.M. MDT"

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nObama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support\n\nLORAIN, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Barack Obama accused Democratic presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday of trying to walk away from a long record of support for NAFTA, the free trade agreement that he said has cost ##,### jobs in Ohio, site of next week's primary.\n\nAt the same time, he said attempts to repeal the trade deal would probably result in more job losses than job gains in the United States.\n\nOne day after Clinton angrily accused him of distorting her record on the North American Free Trade Agreement in mass mailings, the Illinois senator was eager to rekindle the long-distance debate, using passages from the former first lady's book as well as her own words.\n\nTen years after NAFTA passed, Senator Clinton said it was good for America, Obama said. Well, I do not think NAFTA has been good for America \u2014 and I never have.\n\nThe fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president, Obama told an audience at a factory that makes wall board, located in a working class community west of Cleveland.\n\nA couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in ####, she said, I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York and America, he said.\n\nThe trade agreement has long been unpopular in the industrial Midwest, where critics blame it for lost jobs and shuttered factories, many of which once employed union workers who tend to vote Democratic.\n\nOhio and Texas both hold primaries next week, with ### delegates combined, and former President Clinton has said publicly his wife probably needs to win both of them if she is to win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nVermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on March #, but have far fewer delegates and have not attracted nearly as much attention.\n\nOn another issue, Obama said he was not concerned that Republicans might attempt to depict him as unpatriotic if he becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nAsked about a series of events, such as not placing his hand over his heart during the national anthem, he said, The way I will respond to it is with the truth. That I owe everything I am to this country.\n\nHe also said patriotism had more than one definition, and that Republicans had presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed or were sent into the war zone without enough training.\n\nPolls show Clinton with a narrowing lead in Ohio, where trade has long been a sensitive issue.\n\nGiven that backdrop, the issue is the core of Obama's drive to win the Ohio primary and possibly force Clinton from the race.\n\nAt the news conference, he noted that she had said Saturday that the agreement was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush, and passed and signed into law while her husband was in the White House.\n\nHe said Clinton has essentially presented herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.\n\nOn Saturday, Clinton called attention to her plan to fix problems with NAFTA and a commitment against any future trade deals unless they are positive for American workers.\n\nTo an audience of Boilermakers Union members and their families, Obama promised the same thing, with particular attention paid to labor and environmental concerns.\n\nNow, if we are honest with ourselves, we will acknowledge that we cannot stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs are not coming back, he said. But what I refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas."

The fact is, the United States economy has been stuck in a rut for a year and a half.\n\nYet a destructive passivity has overtaken our discourse. Turn on your TV and you\u2019ll see some self-satisfied pundit declaring that nothing much can be done about the economy\u2019s short-run problems (reminder: this \u201cshort run\u201d is now in its fourth year), that we should focus on the long run instead.\n\nThis gets things exactly wrong. The truth is that creating jobs in a depressed economy is something government could and should be doing. Yes, there are huge political obstacles to action \u2014 notably, the fact that the House is controlled by a party that benefits from the economy\u2019s weakness. But political gridlock should not be conflated with economic reality.\n\nOur failure to create jobs is a choice, not a necessity \u2014 a choice rationalized by an ever-shifting set of excuses."

Welcome to Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania. i am Campbell Brown.\n\nTonight, we bring you something different in this already extraordinary campaign year. We are calling it the Compassion Forum, an evening with the Democratic presidential candidates to focus on the issues of faith and compassion and how a president's faith can affect us all.\n\n\n\nThe focus tonight is to take the conversation beyond the candidate's standard policy points. And some of these questions tonight will be deeply personal.\n\n\n\nWe are here before a distinguished, bipartisan audience of faith leaders from around the country, from the head of the Southern Baptist Convention to the head of Catholic charities to rabbis and lay leaders.\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, on behalf of CNN and the candidates, I'd like to thank the people behind tonight's event, Faith in Public Life, the ONE Campaign, Oxfam America, and, of course, our hosts, Messiah College.\n\n\n\nAnd I'd like now to introduce my co-host. Please welcome Jon Meacham.

I want to thank Messiah College for hosting this. Very good of you to do this.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: Senator, we will start with the news. You have been extremely critical of Senator Obama's recent comments in San Francisco in which he argued that some hard-pressed Americans have -- economically hard-pressed Americans have, and I quote, gotten bitter and cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are not like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.\n\n\n\nSenator, you have written of how faith sustained you in bitter times. Many of us have been sustained by our faith in bitter times. What exactly is wrong with what Senator Obama had to say?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, i am going to let Senator Obama speak for himself. But from my perspective, the characterization of people in a way that really seemed to be elitist and out of touch is something that we have to overcome.\n\n\n\nYou know, the Democratic Party, to be very blunt about it, has been viewed as a party that did not understand and respect the values and the way of life of so many of our fellow Americans.\n\n\n\nAnd I think it's important that we make clear that we believe people are people of faith because it is part of their whole being; it is what gives them meaning in life, through good times and bad times. It is there as a spur, an anchor, to center one in the storms, but also to guide one forward in the day-to-day living that is part of everyone's journey.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, when we think about the legitimate concerns that people have about trade or immigration, those are problems to be solved. And that is what I think we should be focused on.\n\n\n\nBut I am very confident that, as we move forward tonight and beyond, people will get a chance to get to know each of us a little better, and that is really what I want to talk about. I will leave it to Senator Obama to speak for himself; he does an excellent job of that.\n\n\n\nAnd I will speak for myself on what my faith journey is and what, you know, leads me to this chair here tonight.\n\n\n\nBROWN: But, Senator, you have been out there on the stump attacking him pretty aggressively over this. And his response has been -- and he said it pretty bluntly tonight -- shame on you. You know that he is a man of faith. This is what he's saying. And to suggest that he is demeaning religion is you playing politics. CLINTON: Well, he will have to speak for himself and provide his own explanation. But I do think it raises a lot of concerns and we have seen that exhibited in the last several days by people here in Pennsylvania, in Indiana where I was yesterday, and elsewhere, because it did seem so much in-line with what often we are charged with.\n\n\n\nSomeone goes to a closed-door fund-raiser in San Francisco and makes comments that do seem elitist, out of touch and, frankly, patronizing. That has nothing to do with him being a good man or a man of faith.\n\n\n\nWe had two very good men and men of faith run for president in #### and ####. But large segments of the electorate concluded that they did not really understand or relate to or frankly respect their ways of life.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that is an issue for voters, as i have heard today from people I visited in Scranton and elsewhere. So this is a legitimate political issue. And there are some issues that are not. But this one is.\n\n\n\nAnd I do believe that Senator Obama will have a chance to explain himself tonight. And i am sure he will take that opportunity.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's talk about your faith. And we warned people the questions tonight would be pretty personal. So I want to ask you. You said in an interview last year that you believe in the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. And you have actually felt the presence of the Holy Spirit on many occasions.\n\n\n\nShare some of those occasions with us.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: You know, I have, ever since i have been a little girl, felt the presence of God in my life. And it has been a gift of grace that has, for me, been incredibly sustaining. But, really, ever since I was a child, I have felt the enveloping support and love of God and I have had the experiences on many, many occasions where I felt like the holy spirit was there with me as I made a journey.\n\n\n\nIt did not have to be a hard time. You know, it could be taking a walk in the woods. It could be watching a sunset.\n\n\n\nYou know, I am someone who has talked a lot about my life. You know more about my life than you know about nearly anybody else's, about ## books worth...\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: ... some of which are, you know, frankly, a little bit off-base. But I do not think that I could have made my life's journey without being anchored in God's grace and without having that, you know, sense of forgiveness and unconditional love. And I am not going to point to one or another matter. I mean, some of my struggles and challenges have been extremely public. And I have talked about how I have been both guided and supported through those, trying to find my own way through, because, for me, my faith has given me the confidence to make decisions that were right for me, whether anybody else agreed with me or not.\n\n\n\nAnd it is just such a part of who I am and what I have lived through for so many years that trying to pull out and say, oh, I remember, I was sitting right there when I felt, you know, God's love embrace me, would be, I think, trivializing what has been an extraordinary sense of support and possibility that I have had with me my entire life.\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: Senator, you -- right after New Hampshire, you and I had a conversation a couple of days after that in which you described your moment in the setting where you said that you worked very hard and it was seen as a turning point by many people. You described that as a moment of grace.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Yes.\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: So that is a specific in...\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Right, right. Well, you know, Jon, it is -- it is perhaps a reluctance on my part that is rooted in my personal reserve, rooted in the way I was raised, that I worry and I -- you know, I understand you want to ask a lot of personal questions, and I appreciate that.\n\n\n\nBut I also worry, as I suggested to you in that same interview, that you have to walk the walk of faith. And talking about it is important because it's important to share that experience. But I also believe that, you know, faith is just -- it's grace. It's love. It's mystery. It's provocation.\n\n\n\nIt is everything that makes life and its purpose meaningful as a human being.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: And those moments of grace are ones that I cherish and, you know, in asked a specific question about how I felt when I shared my belief that politics is not a game, it is not a who's up, who's down.\n\n\n\nI mean, it is a serious search and we are so fortunate because we have taken the gifts that God gave us and we have created this democracy where we choose our leaders and we have to be more mindful of how important and serious a business this is.\n\n\n\nAnd, therefore, when I say politics is not a game, it is really coming from deep within me because I know that we have the opportunity to really give other people a chance to live up to their own God-given potential. And that, to me, is the kind of grace note that makes politics worthwhile. Because, believe me, there is a lot about it that is not particularly welcoming or easy.\n\n\n\nBut every day as I travel around the country, I meet people whose faith just knocks me over. I mean, I was with a woman in Philadelphia Friday morning whose son was murdered on the streets in Philadelphia, whose grandson was murdered. And she and I just sat together and she told me about how strong her faith is and how it has sustained her and how she believes, you know, God is with her and she does not understand why this happened to her son and her grandson.\n\n\n\nBut every day she's grateful, and she is determined to be the person that she believes God meant her to be. And so when I sit there and I listen to that woman tell me about how it felt and how today she is still, you know, getting up every morning, has a smile on her face, looking to go to her daycare business and take care of all of these children who have been entrusted to her, that is a moment of grace.\n\n\n\nBut it's not about me. I mean, not every moment of grace is about you. More often it is about the interaction and the relationship. You know, grace is that relationship with God. But it's also the relationships with our fellow human beings in which we know grace is present. And so I just feel very fortunate that, you know, I have been able to experience that and I wish it for everyone.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's bring a question in from one of the religious leaders joining us tonight. Dr. Joel Hunter, who is senior pastor of the ##,###-member Northland Church in Longwood, Florida. Dr. Hunter?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: How are you, Dr. Hunter? Good to see you.\n\n\n\nPASTOR JOEL HUNTER, NORTHLAND CHURCH: i am fine, Senator. Good to see you. Senator, many of the issues we are going to be talking about tonight, Darfur, AIDS, abortion, torture, could present you with choices that will have life and death consequences for countless people around the world. What are the first principles you fall back on to make such decisions? Are there certain activities or references or people with whom you consult in order to do what is morally right?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: You know, Dr. Hunter, I think this is one of the challenges that face any of us who are in public life where literally you do have the authority to make these decisions that could very well be life and death decisions and they are daunting and I do not pretend to know how I will deal with every single one of them.\n\n\n\nBut I do have a sense of the process by which I will try to approach them. And it really is rooted in, you know, my prayer, my contemplation, my study. I think you have to immerse yourself in advice, information, criticism from others. I do not pretend to even believe that I know the answers to a lot of these questions. I do not.\n\n\n\nBut I do believe that you have to be willing to expose yourself to many different points of view and then you have to make that decision. I think that for a lot of us, decisions are ones that you do not just make and put on a shelf. To be fair to be constantly struggling and challenging yourself, you have to keep opening up that decision and asking.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: And very often, as you know, some decisions look like they are ###-to-nothing until you actually examine them. And some decisions truly are right down the middle, and you are not sure which side of the line you will decide upon.\n\n\n\nYou mentioned some of the very difficult decisions that we are going to face, and there are countless more. How do we get out of Iraq the right way? Everyone knows there is no easy, comfortable decision.\n\n\n\nI believe we have got to begin taking our troops out of Iraq based on my analysis of what I think is the best path forward for us and for the Iraqis. But I am deeply aware that there will be predictable and unpredictable consequences. And part of making a decision is having to live with the consequences.\n\n\n\nAnd I have been very fortunate in my life to have people whom I feel very comfortable talking to openly, with total frankness, seeking their guidance. They do not all agree with me; they do not all share my view, when I start the conversation, perhaps.\n\n\n\nBut I do not think you can surround yourself only with people with whom you think you will agree. And, for me, being amongst people who challenge me, who make me uncomfortable, to be very blunt, is an important part of my decisionmaking process.\n\n\n\nI want to push back; I want to argue; I want to raise other hypotheticals and throw them back to see what the outcome is.\n\n\n\nBut at the end of the day, since we are running to be the president of the United States, you have to be comfortable making a decision, because you cannot say, Well, let's put it on the back burner and then get back to it some time when it's clearer, for many of these decisions. And then you have to live with the consequences.\n\n\n\nBut I hope I will never, ever find myself being defensive or abrupt and dismissive of people who disagree with me. I regret that that often happens in politics, and maybe it's because oftentimes the decisionmaking process is so exhausting.\n\n\n\nYou know, if you are a person of faith, after you have prayed, if you are a person willing to subject yourself to criticism, after you have done it, you are just so relieved to make the decision you do not want to revisit it. But I do not think that a president can afford to do that.\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: Senator, do you believe personally that life begins at conception?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I believe that the potential for life begins at conception. I am a Methodist, as you know. My church has struggled with this issue. In fact, you can look at the Methodist Book of Discipline and see the contradiction and the challenge of trying to sort that very profound question out.\n\n\n\nBut for me, it is also not only about a potential life; it is about the other lives involved. And, therefore, I have concluded, after great, you know, concern and searching my own mind and heart over many years, that our task should be in this pluralistic, diverse life of ours in this nation that individuals must be entrusted to make this profound decision, because the alternative would be such an intrusion of government authority that it would be very difficult to sustain in our kind of open society.\n\n\n\nAnd as some of you have heard me discuss before, I think abortion should remain legal, but it needs to be safe and rare.\n\n\n\nAnd I have spent many years now, as a private citizen, as first lady, and now as senator, trying to make it rare, trying to create the conditions where women had other choices.\n\n\n\nI have supported adoption, foster care. I helped to create the campaign against teenage pregnancy, which fulfilled our original goal ## years ago of reducing teenage pregnancies by about a third.\n\n\n\nAnd I think we have to do even more.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: And I am committed to doing that. And I guess I would just add from my own personal experience, I have been in countries that have taken very different views about this profoundly challenging question.\n\n\n\nSome of you know, I went to China in #### and spoke out against the Chinese government's one child policy, which led to forced abortions and forced sterilization because I believed that we needed to bear witness against what was an intrusive, abusive, dehumanizing effort to dictate how women and men would proceed with respect to the children they wished to have.\n\n\n\nAnd then shortly after that, I was in Romania and there I met women who had been subjected to the Communist regime of the ####s and '##s where they were essentially forced to bear as many children as possible for the good of the state. And where abortion was criminalized and women were literally forced to have physical exams and followed by the secret police and so many children were abandoned and left to the orphanages that, unfortunately, led to an AIDS epidemic.\n\n\n\nSo, you know, when I think about this issue, I think about the whole range of concerns and challenges associated with it and I will continue to do what I can to reduce the number and to improve and increase the care for women and particularly the adoption system and the other opportunities that women would have to make different choices.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Senator, I want to go to the other end of the spectrum and the end of life and ask you, do you believe it is compassionate, that it is appropriate to let someone who is really suffering choose to end their life?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Again, this is one of those incredibly challenging issues. You know, the Terry Schiavo case in Florida posed that for many people. And it was one of those decisions to go back to Dr. Hunter's point, where there were people of good faith and people of strong feelings on both sides about what should happen to that woman's life.\n\n\n\nAnd I do not know that any of us is in a position to make that choice for families or for individuals, but I do not want us also to condone government action that would legitimize or encourage end of life decisions. Somehow there has to be a framework for us to determine how can people who are either able to make these decisions on their own do so? Or if they are not, how best do we create a decision process for their families to try to decide?\n\n\n\nAnd now we are being faced with a lot of these difficult decisions because of what the world we live in today with modern technology and so much else. And we are going to have to come to grips with them one way or another.\n\n\n\nBROWN: we have got to take a quick break, a commercial break. we will be back. Much more with Senator Clinton, right after this.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBROWN: Welcome back to The Compassion Forum, everyone. we are here with Senator Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nAnd, Senator, there are a lot of Americans who are uncomfortable with the conversation that we are having here tonight. That they believe religion already has way too much influence in political life and public life. How do you reassure them?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, I understand that concern because part of our obligation as leaders in America is to make sure that any conversation about religion is inclusive and respectful. And that has not always happened, as we know. And it is so personal. The spiritual journey that each of us takes or does not take.\n\n\n\nAnd I think it's important that we recognize that for good cause, I mean, we have been such a vibrant nation when it comes to religious experience in large measure because we have always protected ourselves against, you know, religion going too far, being too intrusive. So it is a balance. And we want religion to be in the public square. If you are a person of faith, you have a right and even an obligation to speak from that wellspring of your faith. But to do so in a respectful and inclusive way.\n\n\n\nSo I understand why some people, even religious people, even people of faith might say, why are you having this forum? And why are you exploring these issues from two people who are vying to be president of the United States?\n\n\n\nAnd I think that is a fair question to ask. I am here because I think it's also fair for us to have this conversation. But i am very conscious of how thoughtful we must proceed.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Another question from the audience. Rabbi Steve Gutow, who is director of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs is with us.\n\n\n\nRabbi?\n\n\n\nRABBI STEVE GUTOW, JEWISH COUNCIL FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS: Senator Clinton?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Yes, Rabbi.\n\n\n\nGUTOW: Back to China. China has continued to persecute and subject to oppression, the people of Tibet. It continues to be the largest supplier of weapons to Sudan and the largest purchaser of its oil. Let's just say China is not doing all it can to stop the genocide in Darfur. You have said that America needs to return to being a moral voice of the world.\n\n\n\nIs our participation in the Beijing Olympics harmful to that moral voice?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, Rabbi, I appreciate your asking this question because I think it's a question of both political and moral significance. And that is why last week I called on our president to decide he would not attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics because that is a public and very obvious ratification of our government's approval of the Beijing government's actions.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Unless the Chinese began to take very visible steps to begin to end the suppression of the Tibetans and undermining their culture and religious beliefs, and if we could get more cooperation out of the Chinese government with respect to Sudan.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, I would welcome even more action on behalf of human rights. But the challenge is, how do we try to influence the Chinese government? And I believe we have missed many opportunities during the Bush administration to do so.\n\n\n\nIn fact, I think it's fair to say our policy toward China is incoherent and that has not been in the best interest of our values or our strategic interest. So I would urge the president at least to consider and, therefore, publicly say that he will not be attending the opening ceremonies.\n\n\n\nAnd let's see whether the Chinese government begins to respond because that for them would be a great loss of face and perhaps we would get more cooperation. We would get the process going that the Dalai Lama has asked for over many years.\n\n\n\nThere could be a lot of ways that the Chinese government demonstrated it heard our concerns.\n\n\n\nBROWN: A question from Reverend William Shaw. He is the president of the National Baptist Convention.\n\n\n\nReverend Shaw?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: He is. Hello, Reverend Shaw. Good to see you again.\n\n\n\nREV. WILLIAM J. SHAW, NATIONAL BAPTIST CONVENTION: Senator. Current U.S. policies toward developing countries -- trade policies, make it sometimes extremely difficult for poor people to access inexpensive, generic drugs for the treatment of AIDS and other sicknesses.\n\n\n\nHow would you shape the policies of your administration to ensure that the poor would have access to and could secure the drugs that they need to improve the quality of their lives, of their families and even the future of their country?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, Reverend Shaw, I agree with your description of this problem, and I believe that our government must do so much more to get generic drugs and low-cost drugs to people suffering.\n\n\n\nNot only from HIV/AIDS, but the range of diseases that affect disproportionately the poor. It's one of the reasons why I voted against the free trade agreement with Central America, because there was a provision that would give even more power to our pharmaceutical companies to prevent exactly doing what you are discussing.\n\n\n\nI have been an outspoken advocate in urging that both our great pharmaceutical companies -- which do a lot of good. Because, after all, they invent the compounds and put them together that the generics then are able to copy.\n\n\n\nBut we need to do much more to get our pharmaceutical companies to work with us to get the drug costs down and to open the pathway for generic drugs. And that is going to take presidential leadership.\n\n\n\nI commend President Bush for his PEPFAR initiative. It was a very bold and important commitment, but it did not go far enough in opening up the door to generics and getting the costs down.\n\n\n\nAnd as president, I will do that.\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: Senator, we have heard about HIV/AIDS. Many people here are concerned about Darfur and a number of other humanitarian issues. Why do you think it is that a loving God allows innocent people to suffer?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well...\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: And we just have ## seconds.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Yes. You know, that is the subject of generations of commentary and debate. And I do not know. I cannot wait to ask him. Because I have...\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: I have just pondered it endless endlessly.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: But I do want to just add that what that means to me is that in the face of suffering, there is no doubt in my mind that God calls us to respond. You know, that is part of what we are expected to do.\n\n\n\nFor whatever reason it exists, it's very existence is a call to action. Certainly in, you know, our...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nCLINTON: You know, in my Judeo-Christian faith tradition, in both the Old and the New Testament, the incredible demands that God places on us and that the prophets ask of us, and that Christ called us to respond to on behalf of the poor are unavoidable.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: And it's always been curious to me how our debate about religion in America too often misses that. You know, his holiness, the pope, is going to be coming to America next week, and he's been a strong voice on behalf of what we must do to deal with poverty, and deal with injustice, and deal with what is truly our obligations toward those who are the least among us.\n\n\n\nSo maybe, you know, the lord is just waiting for us to respond to his call, because this despair, this impoverishment of body and soul is what we are expected to be spending our time responding to, and so few of us do.\n\n\n\nEven those who are doing wonderful work with organizations represented in this audience, we are just not doing enough. And it's a personal call; it's a family community, religious call; and it's a governmental call. And we have got to do more to respond to that call.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBROWN: Quickly, just you brought up the Bible. We were talking theology. Do you have a favorite Bible story?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Oh, I have so many of them. You know, I was fortunate as a child growing up to be read Bible stories, to go to Sunday school, to go to Bible school. And Bill and I read, you know, Bible stories to Chelsea.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, I have talked about Bible stories and parables a lot in my life with friends. And, you know, it depends upon what is going on in my life at the time.\n\n\n\nBut clearly, for me, the recent Purim holiday for Jews raised the question of Esther. And I have been -- ever since I was a little girl -- a great admirer of Esther. And I used to ask that that be read to me over and over again, because there were not too many models of women who had the opportunity to make a decision, to take a chance, a risk that, you know, was very courageous.\n\n\n\nAnd so that is the one that is most recently on my mind, because I have some rabbi friends who send me readings that go with the scripture of the week. And certainly, Esther is someone who I wish I knew even more about than what we know from the Bible.\n\n\n\nBROWN: A question from Eboo Patel, who is a Muslim, is the founder and executive director of the Interfaith Youth Core.\n\n\n\nWelcome.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Hello.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: As-Salamu Alaykum, Senator Clinton.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n\n\n\nQUESTION: My name is Eboo Patel. i am an American Muslim, and I lead an organization called the Interfaith Youth Core. And it's my privilege to watch a range of faith communities come together around the common value of compassion.\n\n\n\nAmericans of all faiths and no faith at all genuinely believe in compassion and want to apply that in addressing global poverty and climate change. Can we do that without changing our standard of living?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, I believe there is so much we can do that we are not doing that would not change our standard of living as an imposition from the outside, but which would inspire us to take action that would impact how we live.\n\n\n\nAnd I do not think we would notice it demonstrably undermining our standard of living, but it would give us the opportunity to set an example and to be a model.\n\n\n\nWhen I think about the simple steps any one of us can take -- you know, turning off lights when one leaves a room, unplugging appliances, changing to compact florescent bulbs -- you know, my husband and I have done that -- I do not think it's impacted our standard of living, but we feel like we are making a small contribution to limiting the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, you know, being more mindful of our purchases.\n\n\n\nI hope that, as president, I can model that and lead that effort so that people do not feel so threatened by the changes we are talking about when it comes to dealing with global warming.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the pope's visit, I was reading that the Vatican is the first carbon-neutral state in the world now. Well, that shows leadership. And I do not think it has impacted the work or the living. You know, Ambassador Flynn, who was our ambassador to the Vatican, might know. But it was a great statement.\n\n\n\nAnd we can do more.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: And I think that, with leadership, people will find ways to take those first steps. And then we can take even more.\n\n\n\nNow there is so much that I have to do as president with the cap in trade system, with moving away from our dependence on foreign oil, but i am going to look for ways that will cushion the costs on middle class and working and poor people. Because I do not believe that they should have to bear more than what they are bearing right now as we make this transition. And I believe we can accomplish that.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's go to Lisa Sharon Harper. She is the executive director of New York Faith and Justice. Welcome to you.\n\n\n\nLISA SHARON HARPER, N.Y. FAITH AND JUSTICE: Thank you. Senator Clinton, underdeveloped nations and regions that lack widespread access to education and basic resources like water, and they tend to be some of the most unstable and dangerous regions of the world. Places like Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan. Our national security is at stake, but our military is stretched. As president, would you consider committing U.S. troops to a purely humanitarian mission under the leadership of a foreign flag?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, let me start by saying, No. #, I believe strongly that we have to get back to leading on issues like health care and education and women's rights around the world. I have introduced legislation called The Education for All Act. And it's bipartisan. I introduced it first in '## and then we reintroduced it on a bipartisan basis in '##.\n\n\n\nAnd the work that I would want to do to have the United States lead the world in putting the ## million kids who are not in school into school, having us lead when it comes to health care, particularly in malaria, T.B., HIV/AIDS, but also women's health which has been woefully neglected.\n\n\n\nI believe we should demonstrate our commitment to people who are poor, disenfranchised, disempowered before we talk about putting troops anywhere. The United States has to be seen again as a peacekeeper, and we have lost that standing in these last seven years.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I want us to have a partnership, government to government, government with the private sector, government with our NGOS and our faith community to show the best of what America has to offer. You know, I really appreciated President Bush after the tsunami struck, asking his father and my husband to represent the United States and our concern for the people who have been devastated.\n\n\n\nAnd, yes, the military was there delivering supplies. That sent a loud message and it was resonating throughout South Asia -- in Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world. America's favorability rose dramatically because we were seen as caring and compassionate toward those with whom we had very little contact or, in fact, some, you know, level of distrust previously.\n\n\n\nSo I think we have to concentrate first and foremost on restoring our moral authority in the world and our standing in the world. And there are lots of ways that the United States military can be helpful and can show the better face of America. After the Pakistan earthquakes, we sent in military teams to help people. So I think that is my emphasis right now.\n\n\n\nBefore we get to what we might do hypothetically, let's see what we will do realistically to rebuild America's moral authority and demonstrate our commitment to compassionate humanitarianism.\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: Senator, this is our last question for you. To return to faith, do you believe God wants you to be president?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Well, I could be glib and say we will find out, but I -- I do not presume anything about God. I believe, you know, Abraham Lincoln was right in admonishing us not to act as though we knew God was on our side. In fact, our mission should be on God's side. And I have tried to take my beliefs, my faith and put it to work my entire life. And it has been gratifying to do the little i have done to try to help other people, which is really what motivates me.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: that is why I get up in the morning and see whether there is an individual I can help or a problem I can solve.\n\n\n\nAnd I would not presume to even imagine that God is going to tell me what I should do. I think that he has given me enough guidance, you know, through how I have been raised and how I have been, thankfully, given access to the Bible over so many years, commentary and the like.\n\n\n\nSo I just get up and try to do the best I can. And I think that I see through a glass darkly. I do not believe that any of us know it all and can with any confidence say that we are going to, you know, be doing God's will unless, you know, we are just out there doing our very best, hoping that we make a difference in people's lives.\n\n\n\nAnd that is what I am trying to do in this campaign. that is what I would try to do as president.\n\n\n\nAnd I could not be sitting here had it not been for the, you know, gift of grace and faith that keeps me going and, frankly, challenges me. You know, we have not talked much about the challenge that faith gives us individually.\n\n\n\nI really worry when people become very complacent in their faith, when they do believe they have all the answers, because I just do not think it's humanly possible for any of us to know God's mind. I think we are just searching.\n\n\n\nWe are on this journey together, and we need to approach it with a great deal of humility. And that is what i am trying to do in this campaign, and we will see what turns out. But whatever happens, I will get up the next day and try to continue on my journey to do what I can to try to fulfill what I believe to be God's expectations of us.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Senator Clinton, it was a very different kind of evening. you have been a good sport. Thank you.\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Thank you.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBROWN: And, of course, that is only half of our conversation we are having here tonight. Senator Clinton, before you leave the stage, I'd like to bring out now your opponent in this race, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBROWN: Thanks, everybody. When we come back in just a moment, questions for Senator Obama.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBROWN: Welcome back, everybody, to the Compassion Forum. And Senator Obama is joining us now. Thanks for being with us. OBAMA: Thank you so much for having me.\n\n\n\nBROWN: So i am going to start with something that is been in the news. I do not have to tell you that you made some comments recently that are generating a lot of controversy. And I want to remind the audience and our viewers of what you had said.\n\n\n\nYou were talking about people here in small towns in Pennsylvania suffering economic hardship. And you said, quote, It's not surprising they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are not like them.\n\n\n\nAnd to a lot of the religious leaders in this room, to a lot of decent, hardworking people out there, it may have come across as you attacking their values or their religion, suggesting that people are clinging to religion.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, you know, scripture talks about clinging to what is good. And so it's very important -- my words may have been clumsy, which happens surprisingly often on a presidential campaign...\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\n... but this is something that i have talked about before, i have talked about in my own life, which is that religion is a bulwark, a foundation when other things are not going well. that is true in my own life, through trials and tribulations.\n\n\n\nAnd so what I was referring to was in no way demeaning a faith that I, myself, embrace. What I was saying is that when economic hardship hits in these communities, what people have is they have got family, they have got their faith, they have got the traditions that have been passed onto them from generation to generation. Those are not bad things. that is what they have left.\n\n\n\nAnd, unfortunately, what people have become bitter about -- and oftentimes have told me about, as I traveled through not just Pennsylvania, but I was referring to states all across the Midwest, including my home state -- is any confidence that the government is listening to them. They do not think that government is listening to them.\n\n\n\nSo I think it is very important to understand -- and I think it's unfortunate that, in the political process, presidential campaigns, that people have been trying to misconstrue my words -- to understand that, you know, I am a devout Christian, that I started my work working with churches in the shadow of steel plants that had closed on the south side of Chicago, that nobody in a presidential campaign on the Democratic side in recent memory has done more to reach out to the church and talk about, what are our obligations religiously, in terms of doing good works, and how does that inform our politics?\n\n\n\nSo I think that this is an example of, frankly, how the political debate can distract us from what is really at issue and that is: How are we going to create a just and fair society where people are getting a fair shake? And that is why i am running this campaign.\n\n\n\nBROWN: And Hillary Clinton, who was just here, said you are being elitist.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, that is, I think, a good example of what happens on the presidential campaign, is that we try to tear each other down instead of lifting the country up.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: But, you know, the notion that somebody like myself, who has been working in churches since I got out of college. and whose entire trajectory, not just during this campaign, but long before, has been to talk about how Democrats need to get in church, reach out to evangelicals, link faith with the work that we do.\n\n\n\nThe notion that somehow I am standing above that when that essentially describes much of what i have been doing over the last ## years does not make much sense.\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: Senator, do you believe that God intervenes in history and rewards or punishes people or nations in real time for their behavior?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, what I believe is that God intervenes, but that his plans are a little too mysterious for me to grasp. And so what I try to do is, as best I can, be an instrument of his will. To act in what I think is accordance to the precepts of my faith.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, if i am acting in an ethical way, if I am working to make sure that I am applying what I consider to be a core value of Christianity, but also a core value of all great religions, and that is that I am my brother's keeper and I am my sister's keeper, then I will be doing my part to move his agenda forward.\n\n\n\nI do not know what that master plan is. And I do not presume to know. And I think that none of us know. But what we do -- what I think we can do is to act in ways that are consummate with the values that we cherish.\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes that is harder to do in politics than it should be. But I think that is what is demanded of us.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's take a question from Reverend Samuel Rodriguez, who is with us. He is president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.\n\n\n\nReverend?\n\n\n\nREV. SAMUEL RODRIGUEZ, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL HISPANIC LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE: Senator Obama, the vast majority of Americans believe that abortion is a decision to be made by a woman, her family and her doctors. However, the vast majority of Americans similarly believe that abortion is the taking of a human life.\n\n\n\nThe terms pro-choice and pro-life, do they encapsulate that reality in our ##st Century setting and can we find common ground? OBAMA: I absolutely think we can find common ground. And it requires a couple of things. Number one, it requires us to acknowledge that there is a moral dimension to abortion, which I think that all too often those of us who are pro-choice have not talked about or tried to tamp down. I think that is a mistake because I think all of us understand that it is a wrenching choice for anybody to think about.\n\n\n\nThe second thing, once we acknowledge that, is to recognize that people of good will can exist on both sides. That nobody wishes to be placed in a circumstance where they are even confronted with the choice of abortion. How we determine what is right at that moment, I think, people of good will can differ.\n\n\n\nAnd if we can acknowledge that much, then we can certainly agree on the fact that we should be doing everything we can to avoid unwanted pregnancies that might even lead somebody to consider having an abortion.\n\n\n\nAnd we have actually made progress over the last several years in reducing teen pregnancies, for example. And what I have consistently talked about is to take a comprehensive approach where we focus on abstinence, where we are teaching the sacredness of sexuality to our children.\n\n\n\nBut we also recognize the importance of good medical care for women, that we are also recognizing the importance of age-appropriate education to reduce risks. I do believe that contraception has to be part of that education process.\n\n\n\nAnd if we do those things, then I think that we can reduce abortions and I think we should make sure that adoption is an option for people out there. If we put all of those things in place, then I think we will take some of the edge off the debate.\n\n\n\nwe are not going to completely resolve it. I mean, there -- you know, at some point, there may just be an irreconcilable difference. And those who are opposed to abortion, I think, should continue to be able to lawfully object and try to change the laws.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Those of us, like myself, who believe that in this difficult situation it is a woman's responsibility and choice to make in consultation with her doctor and her pastor and her family.\n\n\n\nI think we will continue to suggest that that is the right legal framework to deal with the issue. But at least we can start focusing on how to move in a better direction than the one we have been in the past.\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: Senator, do you personally believe that life begins at conception? And if not, when does it begin?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: This is something that I have not, I think, come to a firm resolution on. I think it's very hard to know what that means, when life begins. Is it when a cell separates? Is it when the soul stirs? So I do not presume to know the answer to that question. What I know, as i have said before, is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when we are having these debates.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let me go to, again, are the end of the spectrum on that. There are a lot of philosophical and ethical questions relating to ending one's life. In The Audacity of Hope, you write very movingly about your mother's fight with cancer, the pain she was in and the process that she went through, especially toward the end.\n\n\n\nIn that vein, if someone today was in her position, and wanted to take active steps to end his or her own life, do you think that would be OK morally?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well I think we have to be very careful in making end of life decisions. I believe in first of all everybody having a living will so that their views on these issues can be factored in by family members and their doctors and many of the difficult choices that are made are made because people do not have guidance from the individual.\n\n\n\nI do believe in the importance of medicine and that if somebody is terminally ill, relieving their pain and suffering is the right thing to do. What happens then is you start getting into a gray area where relieving pain and suffering may accelerate death in some situations and that is a decision that should be made by the individual, the family and the doctor.\n\n\n\nI do not think that it's appropriate to empower doctors themselves to make that decision. But I think that it is important for us to be able to allow people who are terminally ill, in excruciating pain, to get the medicine they need to relieve that pain.\n\n\n\nBROWN: By relieve that pain you mean hasten the end of life if they choose to?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: And I think that there has to be very strict guidelines to ensure that somebody who is making a decision to relieve their pain that might take a week away from their life just because they are -- they are slipping into a coma quicker, for example. That that is distinguished from -- or at least there is a possibility that they slip into a coma. That that is distinguished from euthanasia in which someone else is making the decision for them.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's go to Dr. Frank Page, who's with us, president of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\n\n\nDr. Page?\n\n\n\nFRANK PAGE, SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION: Thank you, Senator Obama. Thank you for being here at Messiah College for the Compassion Forum. Southern Baptists have been very active for years in sub- Saharan Africa in the HIV/AIDS relief ministries. Sometimes orphan care, sometimes educational activities.\n\n\n\nBut we also are involved in a ministry called True Love Waits, which has been credited by the government of Uganda from lowering the AIDS infection rate there dramatically from ## percent to # percent. But we also teach a part of that, that faith has a role in the issue of HIV/AIDS. Do you concur with that and would you elaborate on that, please.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Can I just clarify, true love waits is an abstinence program.\n\n\n\nPAGE: Abstinence based and faith based, yes.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well first of all, congratulations to those who have been involved in that work. I think it's important work. And I think you may know my father came from this part of the world. I visited Kenya multiple times. I have been working with a group of grandmas who were helping AIDS orphans in Kenya.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Michelle and I, when we were traveling there, took an AIDS test before thousands of people to encourage the importance of them getting clear on what their status was and hopefully reducing infections.\n\n\n\nAnd, by the way, this is an area where -- this does not happen very often, so everybody should take note -- where I compliment George Bush. I actually think that...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nI actually think that the PEPFAR program is one of the success stories of this administration. we have seen a drastic increase in funding. And terrific work is being done between the CDC, the NIH, local AIDS organizations, NGOs.\n\n\n\nMy view is, is that we should use whatever the best approaches are, the scientifically sound approaches are, to reduce this devastating disease all across the world.\n\n\n\nAnd part of that, I think, should be a strong education component and I think abstinence education is important. I also think that contraception is important; I also think that treatment is important; I also think that we have to do more to make antiviral drugs available to people who are in extreme poverty.\n\n\n\nSo I do not want to pluck out one facet of it. Now, that does not mean that non-for-profit groups cannot focus on one thing while the government focuses on other things. I think we want to have a comprehensive approach.\n\n\n\nI do think that -- and i have said this when I was in Kenya -- that there is a behavioral element to AIDS that has to be addressed. And if there is -- if there is promiscuity and we are pretending that that is not an issue in spreading AIDS, then we are missing part of the answer.\n\n\n\nBut I also think that -- keep in mind, women are far more likely to be infected now between the ages of ## and ## than are men. And that is why focusing, for example, on the status of women, empowering women, giving them microbicides, or other strategies that would allow them to protect themselves when they sometimes in certain situations may not be able to protect themselves from having unprotected sex, all those things are going to be just as important, as well.\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: Sir, in an earlier occasion in...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n... an earlier occasion in talking about your own daughters and talking about sex education and contraception, you said that you would not want your daughter punished with a baby if she made a mistake, that you would teach values and morals, but if something were to happen. The phrase punished with a baby was jarring to a number of people. Could you explain what you meant by that?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, keep in mind, on that same day, I said children are miracles, and so I think it's important not to parse my words too carefully here. What I was saying was that my daughters are # and #.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nAnd so if, at the age of ## or ##, they made what I would consider to be a mistake, in having sex or unprotected sex, and ended up getting pregnant -- I think that statistically we know ##- or ##- year-olds who are having children are much more likely to be impoverished, are much more likely to have health problems, are much more likely to have trouble raising that child.\n\n\n\nAnd so all I meant was we want to prevent teen pregnancies. And what we do not want to do is to be blind to the possibility that kids will screw up, just like, surprisingly enough, we as adults screw up sometimes.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, we should factor in the possibility that they make mistakes in our approach to dealing with STDs, which is what I was being asked about at the time.\n\n\n\nAnd we want to make sure that, even as we are teaching responsible sexuality and we are teaching abstinence to children, that we are also making sure that they have got, you know, enough understanding about contraception that they do not end up having much more severe problems because of a dumb mistake.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Senator, if one of your daughters asked you -- and maybe they already have -- Daddy, did God really create the world in six days? What would you say?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, i am trying to remember if we had this conversation.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, what i have said to them is that I believe that God created the universe and that the six days in the Bible may not be six days as we understand it. It may not be ##-hour days. And that is what I believe. I know there is always a debate between those who read the Bible literally and those who do not. And, you know, that, I think, is a legitimate debate within the Christian community of which I am a part.\n\n\n\nYou know, my belief is, is that the story that the Bible tells about God creating this magnificent Earth on which we live, that that is -- that is essentially true. That is fundamentally true.\n\n\n\nNow whether it happened exactly as we might understand it reading the text of the Bible, that, you know, I do not presume to know.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's go to...\n\n\n\nOBAMA: But let me just make one last point on this. I do believe in evolution. I do not think that is incompatible with Christian faith. Just as I do not think science generally is incompatible with Christian faith.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that this is something that, you know, we get bogged down in. There are those who suggest that if you have a scientific bent of mind, then somehow you should reject religion. And I fundamentally disagree with that.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the more I learn about the world, the more I know about science, the more i am amazed about the mystery of this planet and this universe. And it strengthens my faith as opposed to weakens it.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's go to Reverend Richard Cizik, who is vice president of the National Association of Evangelicals.\n\n\n\nReverend?\n\n\n\nREV. RICHARD CIZIK, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICALS: Good evening, Senator. You just took my question. Congratulations. You won the prize. No, let me flesh this out just a little bit, if you would not mind.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Sure.\n\n\n\nCIZIK: Frankly, there has been perceived, by many, millions, a war between science and faith. I do not believe there is a war at all. In fact, the worlds of religion and science are coming together in amazing ways, including here on this campus.\n\n\n\nFor example, you have young evangelical Christians who are leaders on developing what we call creation care or a policy on climate change. And so let me ask you, you have already hinted at it, but let me ask you in specific.\n\n\n\nHow do you relate your faith our personal convictions to science generally and science policy, and let's take an issue like climate and flesh that out, or take stem cells, something like that. Just give us a little more indication of how you think.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all...\n\n\n\nCIZIK: Is that fair enough?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: It is fair enough. And you guys have done some terrific work on this. So I want to congratulate you on that.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: And should it be part of God's plan to have me in the White House, I look forward to our collaboration.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: So, look, the -- one of the things I draw from the Genesis story is the importance of us being good stewards of the land, of this incredible gift. And I think there have been times where we have not been and this is one of those times where we have got to take the warning seriously.\n\n\n\nI know that Al Gore was mentioned earlier. By the way, I have to say, I think Al Gore won. And...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: And has done terrific work since. But I think that we are seeing enough warning signs for us to take this seriously. And part of what my religious faith teaches me is to take an intergenerational view, to recognize that we are borrowing this planet from our children and our grandchildren.\n\n\n\nAnd so we have got this obligation to them, which means that we have got to make some uncomfortable choices. And where I think potentially religious faith and the science of global warming converge is precisely because it's going to be hard to deal with.\n\n\n\nWe have to find resources in ourselves that allow us to make those sacrifices where we say, you know what? we are not going to leave it to the next generation. we are not going to wait.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: We are going to put in place a cap-and-trade system that controls the amount of greenhouse gases that are going into the atmosphere. And we know that that requires us to make adjustments in terms of how we use energy. we have got to be less wasteful, both as a society and in our own individual lives.\n\n\n\nAnd having faith, believing that this planet and this world extends beyond us, it's not just here for us, but it's here for, you know, more generations to come. I think religion can actually bolster our desire to make those sacrifices now. And that is why, as president, I hope to be able to rally the entire world around the importance of us being good stewards of the land.\n\n\n\nBROWN: All right, Senator Obama, we are going to take a quick break. Everybody stay with us. we will be right back. When we come back, we will ask Senator Obama what he will tell those Americans who say there is too much religion in government.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBROWN: Welcome back, everybody, to Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania. we are talking to the Democratic candidates about how the role of faith and compassion would play in their presidency. Senator Barack Obama is with us now.\n\n\n\nJon?\n\n\n\nMEACHAM: You have spoken about how your former pastor in Chicago, the Jeremiah Wright was critical in helping bring you to Christianity and is like part of your family. Can you tell us how he helped bring you closer to God?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, I actually wrote about this in my second book Audacity of Hope. I had worked as an organizer on the South Side, as I mentioned and it was tough work.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: You know, the community was in difficult straits. And I was bringing churches together to set up job training programs and after-school programs for youth and to try to bring economic development to the community.\n\n\n\nI had been raised in a nonreligious home. My mother was the most spiritual person I know, but was mistrustful of organized religion, in part because of some of her experiences seeing segregation being compatible with organized religion. And so we went to church very infrequently.\n\n\n\nSo as i am doing this organizing, some of the pastors started saying, You know, you have got great ideas, Obama, but, you know, if you are going to organize churches, it might help if you were going to church.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nAnd I thought, Well, that is not an unreasonable position. And so I started visiting some churches. Trinity United Church of Christ was one of the churches that we were trying to get involved in the organization.\n\n\n\nI visited that church and found the ministries that they were doing on HIV/AIDS, on prison ministries, there were a whole host of wonderful ministries that they were engaged in. And Reverend Wright's sermons spoke directly to the social gospel, the need to act and not just to sit in the pews.\n\n\n\nAnd so I found that very attractive and ended up joining the church when I got out of law school. Now, I have to say that, you know, in reports subsequently, there is been this notion that he was, by various terms, my spiritual adviser or my spiritual mentor. You know, he's been my pastor.\n\n\n\nAnd what that means is, is that, you know, the ministries that have been built in that church community have been very important to me. It also means that there are areas where we have disagreed on. And, obviously, the most recent loop that is been playing -- Reverend Wright's greatest hits, so to speak...\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\n... are, I think, both a distortion of who he is and what the church has been about, but also express...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\n... but also express, you know, some comments that I think are deeply offensive and are contrary to what I believe. And i have told him so and have made a lot of statements about that, including one pretty long one in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nBut that does not detract...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nThat, I think, does not detract from the incredible church community that this is. And I think that all of us who have been part of a faith community know that the church is a body of believers and it brings in the imperfections of us, men and women.\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, pastors are imperfect. Certainly, the membership is imperfect. I, as somebody who is sitting in the pews as a sinner, is imperfect. And, you know, that does not detract from, I think, what the church is supposed to be about, which is to worship God and proclaim the good news.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Senator, you are a Christian, but as a child you had more exposure to Islam than probably most Americans ever will. How did that shape you?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, I lived in Indonesia for four-and-a-half years when I was a child. And, actually, ironically, the first school I went to in Indonesia was a Catholic school. So, you know, myself and Senator Bob Casey, who's sitting here, we had pretty similar experiences probably, in part, of at least our elementary school.\n\n\n\nI then attended a public school, but the majority of the country was Muslim. And the brand of Islam that was being practiced in Indonesia at the time was a very tolerant Islam. The country itself was explicitly secular in its constitution.\n\n\n\nAnd so you did not have the oppressive state that was trying to impose people's religious beliefs. And Christians and people of other faiths lived very comfortably there. And women were working, and out, and were not wearing the traditional coverings that we see in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nAnd so what it taught me, and what it still teaches me, as I think about foreign policy now, is that Islam can be compatible with the modern world.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: It can be a partner with the Christian and Jewish and Hindu and Buddhist faiths in trying to create a better world.\n\n\n\nAnd so I am always careful and suspicious of attempts to paint Islam with a broad brush because the overwhelming majority of the people of the Islamic faith are people of good will who are trying to raise their families and live up to their values and ideals and to try to raise their kids as best they can and that is something that I think we always have to remember as opposed to assuming a clash of civilizations that sometimes are overheated rhetoric that politically is talked about.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's go to Reverend Jim Wallace.\n\n\n\nReverend Wallace, he is president of Sojourners, a Christian social justice organization.\n\n\n\nREV. JIM WALLACE, PRESIDENT, SOJOURNERS: Hello, Senator.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: How are you, Jim?\n\n\n\nWALLACE: i am good. As you reminded us a week or two ago, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed ## years ago, he was not just speaking about civil rights. He was fighting for economic justice, was about to launch a poor people's campaign.\n\n\n\nYet, four decades after the anniversary of his death, the poverty rate in America is virtually unchanged and one in six of our children are poor in the richest nation in the world.\n\n\n\nSo in the faith community, we are wanting a new commitment around a measurable goal, something like cutting poverty in half in ## years. Would you commit -- would you at this historic compassion forum, commit to such a goal tonight and if elected, tell us how you'd mobilize the nation, mobilize us to achieve that goal?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, Jim, I appreciate the good work you have been doing on these issues. And I absolutely will make that commitment. Understand that when I make that commitment, I do so with great humility because it is a very ambitious goal. And we are going to have to mobilize our society, not just to cut poverty, but to prevent more people from slipping into poverty.\n\n\n\nYou know, this actually goes back to the earlier point you raised where Senator Clinton suggested I was being elitist when I said that people are frustrated and bitter. That is absolutely true. that is not just true in small towns. that is true in urban areas. that is true in my community of the South Side of Chicago. Because people feel forgotten. They feel as if nobody is listening in Washington.\n\n\n\nAnd that every four years we have politicians who come out and make promises and they are not kept. And so that is why I wanted to put the caveat on there. I make that commitment with humility because we have got a lot of work to do economically in this country to bring about a more just and fair economy. It starts with, I think, recognizing the rages and incomes for average families have gone down during the most recent economic expansion. that is never happened before in the history of America since we started recording these statistics, at least since World War II.\n\n\n\nSo we have got to shore up the mortgage market to make sure that we do not have millions of people who are losing their homes. we are going to have to I think change our tax code. For us to provide tax breaks to the wealthiest among us, those who did not need them and were not even asking for them, at a time when ordinary folks are struggling to fill up a gas tank just to get to a job.\n\n\n\nI met a guy here in Pennsylvania when Bob Casey and I were traveling around who told me his problem was he's looking for a job and it costs him more than he can afford just to go to a job interview.\n\n\n\nAnd so we have got to give them some tax relief, and we have got to invest in our infrastructure to create jobs, particularly those who are going to be getting laid off in the construction industry, the housing market goes down. And I put forward very specific plans for that.\n\n\n\nwe are going to have to, I think, invest heavily in clean energy. And if we have a cap in trade system, we can generate $### billion over ## years to invest in solar and wind and biodiesel and train people to build windmills and solar panels and make buildings more energy efficient -- and make alternative fuels.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: All of these things -- all of these things will strengthen the economy generally. And I left out one last point, health care. People are falling into bankruptcy. They are going without medical care. It is a moral imperative that we make sure that we have a plan in place that provides health care to every single American and that has high quality and provides prevention.\n\n\n\nIf we do those things -- and that applies not just to poor people but to working and middle class families all across the country, then we also have to focus on those who, even when the economy is good and the middle class are doing well, are still impoverished, and that is a special challenge.\n\n\n\nAnd that involves, I think, going at the problem at its roots very early. Investing in early childhood education, working with at- risk parents...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: ... drastically improving our education system, K through ##, by paying our teachers more and demanding more from them.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Making sure that we have after-school programs and summer school programs. And many of these, by the way, can be part of a faith community. And so, you know, just to go back to our theme here tonight, people sometimes ask me, what do I think about faith-based initiatives? I want to keep the Office of Faith-Based Initiatives open, but I want to make sure that its mission is clear. It's not to -- it's not to simply build a particular faith community, the faith-based initiatives should be targeted specifically at the issue of poverty and how to lift people up.\n\n\n\nAnd partnering with faith communities, I think we can achieve that as long as it's within the requirements of our Constitution. We make sure that it's open to everybody. It's not simply the federal government funding certain groups to be able to evangelize.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBROWN: Let's go to Dr. David Gushee, who is the president of Evangelicals for Human Rights.\n\n\n\nDr. Gushee?\n\n\n\nDAVID P. GUSHEE, MERCER UNIVERSITY: Senator Obama, recently yet another disturbing memo emerged from the Justice Department. This one said that not even interrogation methods that, quote, shock the conscience would be considered torture nor would they be considered illegal if they had been authorized by the president.\n\n\n\nSenator Obama, this kind of reasoning shocks the conscience of many millions of Americans and many millions of people of faith here and around the world. Is there justification for policies on the part of our nation that permit physical and mental cruelty toward those who are in our custody?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: We have to be clear and unequivocal. We do not torture, period. We do not torture.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Our government does not torture. That should be our position. That should be our position. That will be my position as president. That includes, by the way, renditions. We do not farm out torture. We do not subcontract torture.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: And the reason this is important is not only because torture does not end up yielding good information -- most intelligence officers agree with that. I met with a group -- a distinguished group of former generals who have made it their mission to travel around and talk to presidential candidates and to talk in forums about how this degrades the discipline and the ethos of our military.\n\n\n\nIt is very hard for us when kids, you know, ##, ##, ##, ## are in Iraq having to make difficult decisions, life or death decisions every day, and are being asked essentially to restrain themselves and operate within the law.\n\n\n\nAnd then to find out that our own government is not abiding by these same laws that we are asking them to defend? That is not acceptable. And so my position is going to be absolutely clear.\n\n\n\nAnd it is also important for our long-term security to send a message to the world that we will lead not just with our military might but we are going to lead with our values and our ideals.\n\n\n\nThat we are not a nation...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: ... that gives away our civil liberties simply because we are scared. And we are always at our worst when we are fearful. And one of the things that my religious faith allows me to do, hopefully, is not to operate out of fear.\n\n\n\nFear is a bad counsel and I want to operate out of hope and out of faith.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBROWN: We are almost out of time. I asked the same question to Senator Clinton, though. And it's that there are a lot of Americans who believe the conversation going on here tonight is not necessarily appropriate.\n\n\n\nThey believe that religion has far too much influence in public life. What do you say to that?\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Well, you know, what i have written in the past, what i have -- I actually spoke at a Sojourner's forum two years ago on this precise issue. And I think that we have fallen into a false debate.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, there have been elements, many of them in my own party, in the Democratic Party, that believe that any influence of religion whatsoever in the public debate somehow is problematic or violates church and state.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, there have been those primarily in the other party, in the Republican Party, whose view has been that the separation between church and state should not even be there. And I think both extremes are wrong.\n\n\n\nWhat I believe is that all of us come to the public square with our own values and our ideals and our ethics, what we believe. And people of religious faith have the same right to come to that public square with values and ideals that are rooted in their faith.\n\n\n\nAnd they have the right to describe them in religious terms, which has been part of our history. As I said in some of my writings, imagine Dr. King, you know, going up before, in front of the Lincoln Memorial and having to scrub all his religious references, or Abraham Lincoln in the Second Inaugural not being able to refer to God.\n\n\n\nWhat religious language can often do is allow us to get outside of ourselves and mobilize around a common good.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, what those of us of religious faith have to do when we are in the public square is to translate our language into a universal language that can appeal to everybody.\n\n\n\nAnd both Lincoln and King did this and every great leader did it, because we are not just a Christian nation. We are a Jewish nation; we are a Buddhist nation; we are a Muslim nation; Hindu nation; and we are a nation of atheists and nonbelievers.\n\n\n\nAnd it is important for us not to try to kill the debate by saying, Well, God tells me i am right, and so i am not going to listen to you. Rather, we have got to translate whatever it is that we believe into a language that allows for argument, allows for debate, and also allows that we may be wrong.\n\n\n\nAnd the biggest danger, I think, for those of us of religious faith when we are in the public sphere is a certain self-righteousness, where we start thinking that, Well, you know, i have got a direct line to God. You know, that is incompatible with democracy.\n\n\n\nYou may have a direct line to God. But, you know, that is not -- the public square is not the place for us to empower ourselves in that way.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Many more questions, i am sure, but we have to end it there. we are out of time.\n\n\n\nSenator Barack Obama, thank you very much.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Thank you.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Appreciate it. Thank you.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Are you going to sign off, because I want to just say hi to some people.\n\n\n\nBROWN: Please do. Please do. we are going to sign off.\n\n\n\nOBAMA: Is that OK?\n\n\n\nBROWN: Absolutely.\n\n\n\nI want to thank my co-host, Newsweek's Jon Meacham, as well as all those who joined us for tonight's forum, and also to the folks at Faith in Public Life, the ONE Campaign, and Oxfam America.\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, a big thanks to our hosts here at Messiah College.\n\n\n\nSenator John McCain, we should mention, was not able to join us tonight. We look forward, though, to having him and the eventual Democratic nominee for another Compassion Forum very soon.\n\n\n\ni am Campbell Brown in Grantham, Pennsylvania.

Mr. Ayers, who spent the ####'s as a fugitive in the Weather Underground, was sitting in the kitchen of his big turn-of-the-##th-century stone house in the Hyde Park district of Chicago. The long curly locks in his Wanted poster are shorn, though he wears earrings. He still has tattooed on his neck the rainbow-and-lightning Weathermen logo that appeared on letters taking responsibility for bombings. And he still has the ebullient, ingratiating manner, the apparently intense interest in other people, that made him a charismatic figure in the radical student movement.\n\nNow he has written a book, ''Fugitive Days'' (Beacon Press, September). Mr. Ayers, who is ##, calls it a memoir, somewhat coyly perhaps, since he also says some of it is fiction. He writes that he participated in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in ####, of the Capitol building in ####, the Pentagon in ####. But Mr. Ayers also seems to want to have it both ways, taking responsibility for daring acts in his youth, then deflecting it.\n\n''Is this, then, the truth?,'' he writes. ''Not exactly. Although it feels entirely honest to me.''\n\nBut why would someone want to read a memoir parts of which are admittedly not true? Mr. Ayers was asked.\n\n''Obviously, the point is it's a reflection on memory,'' he answered. ''It's true as I remember it.''"

    "text": "Officials from the two prior administrations, of governors Paul Cellucci and Jane Swift, could not be reached last night, leaving it unclear whether their aides took similar actions regarding hard drives, s, and computer servers.\n\n\u201cThey have an obligation as a public official to preserve their records,\u2019\u2019 Galvin said. \u201cElectronic records are held to the same standard as paper records. There\u2019s no question. They\u2019re not in some lesser standard.\u2019\u2019\n\nGalvin pointed out that, in ####, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that \u201cthe governor is not explicitly included\u2019\u2019 in the Public Records Law. He said that means that s don\u2019t have to be released to the public, but the governor\u2019s office still has to preserve them and turn them over to the state archivist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sell things to people who work for me,\u2019\u2019 said Galvin, a Democrat. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people getting their chair or something as a gift. But generally if you work for me you don\u2019t take your laptop with you when you leave.\u2019\u2019\n\nSecretary of State William F. Galvin, who oversees the state Public Records Law, said it appeared odd that state property - in this case, hard drives - was essentially being sold to private individuals.\n\nShe accused Patrick of \u201cdoing the Obama campaign\u2019s dirty work\u2019\u2019 and called it one in a series of \u201cpolitical attacks to distract from Obama\u2019s horrible record on jobs.\u2019\u2019 Patrick, a Democrat, is a close friend and supporter of President Obama, and is expected to play a prominent role in his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cIn leaving office, the governor\u2019s staff complied with the law and longtime executive branch practice,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cSome employees exercised the option to purchase computer equipment when they left. They did so openly with personal checks.\u2019\u2019\n\nAndrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said the governor\u2019s aides did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s office has found no s from ####-#### in our possession,\u2019\u2019 Reilly said in a statement. \u201cBefore the current administration took office, the computers used during that time period were replaced and the server used during that time period was taken out of service, all files were removed from it, and it was also replaced.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs a result, Patrick\u2019s office, which has been bombarded with inquiries for records from the Romney era, has no electronic record of any Romney administration s, Reilly said.\n\nRomney administration officials had the remaining computers in the governor\u2019s office replaced just before Governor Deval Patrick\u2019s staff showed up to take power in January ####, according to Mark Reilly, Patrick\u2019s chief legal counsel.\n\nJust before Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governor\u2019s office and first ran for president, ## of his top aides purchased their state-issued computer hard drives, and the Romney administration\u2019s s were all wiped from a server, according to interviews and records obtained by the Globe.\n\nJust before leaving office, Romney\u2019s staff went before the Records Conservation Board, which is made up of appointees from various state agencies and reviews public record retention. In some cases, the Romney administration was given permission to destroy records, Galvin said, oftentimes because they were redundant.\n\n\u201cI know that all of the Romney materials were dealt with by the public records board,\u2019\u2019 Galvin said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that what was portrayed to the records board was a complete and accurate summary. I don\u2019t know that.\u2019\u2019\n\nMark Nielsen, who was Romney\u2019s chief legal counsel, bought his hard drive on Dec. ##, ####, just over two weeks before Patrick administration officials took over the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe longstanding practice in the governor\u2019s office was to give employees the option to buy old equipment when they were leaving office, and certain employees, including me, did that,\u2019\u2019 Nielsen told the Globe. \u201cBut those purchases were in conformance with the law and with longstanding executive branch practice.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that we complied with the letter and the spirit of the law,\u2019\u2019 he added. When asked why he would want to purchase his hard drive, he said, \u201cEmployees were given that option and it was my understanding that it was a longstanding practice in the governor\u2019s office.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen asked about replacing the remaining computers and wiping the server clean, he said, \u201cAll I can tell you is we fully complied with the law and complied with longstanding executive branch practice. Nothing unusual was done.\u2019\u2019\n\nPam Wilmot, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, said Romney administration officials may not have violated the letter of the state Public Records Law, but may have run afoul of its spirit.\n\n\u201cInformation that was generated in the administration belongs to the people of the Commonwealth, unless it was personal in nature,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThere is a place for purchasing of surplus property, but there are procedures to do that. And it seems that we are, as a Commonwealth, losing something if all records were deleted.\u2019\u2019\n\nAll told, ## Romney administration officials bought ## hard drives from the governor\u2019s office, paying $## for each one, according to copies of canceled checks that they wrote and members of the current administration. Many of the aides wrote \u201cequipment\u2019\u2019 or \u201chard drives\u2019\u2019 in the memo space on their checks.\n\nBeth E. Myers, who was Romney\u2019s chief of staff, bought her hard drive on Aug. ##, ####, the same month that she left state employment.\n\nShe later became Romney\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nPeter G. Flaherty, who was Romney\u2019s deputy chief of staff, bought the hard drive from his computer on Nov. #, ####, four days before Patrick was elected, defeating his Republican opponent, Kerry Healey, who was Romney\u2019s lieutenant governor. Flaherty later became the Romney campaign\u2019s chief liaison to social conservatives.\n\nThe rest of the hard drives were bought in November and December of #### by other aides.\n\nWhile Patrick aides said they do not have any electronic records of Romney administration s, Galvin said there are ### to ### boxes of paper records from the Romney era at the state archives in Boston.\n\nIn ####, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston was embroiled in controversy after one of his top aides, Michael J. Kineavy, acknowledged that he had deleted nearly every  he sent or received over the previous five years.\n\nThe law requires municipal employees to preserve s for at least two years, even if they have \u201cno informational or evidential value,\u2019\u2019 and provides for penalties of up to a year in jail.\n\nA nine-month investigation by Attorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s office concluded, however, that the destruction of the s was not a crime because Kineavy was not willfully attempting to hide the correspondence from the public.\n\nLevenson can be reached at  Viser can be reached at \n\n\u00a9 Copyright #### Globe Newspaper Company."

Smith, Times Political Editor\n\nIn print: Thursday, June #, #### SCOTT KEELER | Times Story Tools  this story Contact the editor Print this story Comment on this story Social Bookmarking [+] Digg Facebook Stumbleupon Reddit Del.icio.us Newsvine ADVERTISEMENT [EDMUND D. FOUNTAIN | Times] Mike Hughes of Largo, Pam Wilson of Indian Rocks Beach and Nora Harvey of Dunedin sit outside the Renaissance Vinoy Resort in St. Petersburg protesting Sen. John McCain\u2019s fundraiser there Wednesday. About ## people, including Democrats and union members, came out against the presumptive Republican nominee for president, whom they called \u201cMcSame\u201d as President Bush. Wilson made signs for the protest. Jack Ganzell of Dunedin, far right, says he came out because he wanted to see what was going on. Related Links Audio: Excerpts of McCain's interview with the Times' Adam Smith ST. PETERSBURG \u2014 Charlie Crist may not yet have a full gubernatorial term under his belt, but Sen. John McCain said Wednesday Crist has enough experience to be vice president. Oh, I am sure that in many respects Charlie Crist is qualified. He's had other offices. As we know, he was attorney general as well. This is a big and diverse state, McCain said in an interview Wednesday evening before a $#,###-per-person private fundraising reception. But we have not moved anywhere on the process that he would be under, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee stressed. We have a large number of people that we are considering, but I just do not mention anybody's name because then it starts a process that could end up in an invasion of their privacy. In a taped interview to air Sunday on Political Connections on Bay News #, McCain said he will reach out to supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and noted his independence from President Bush on such issues as government spending and climate control. I promise them that i will be the president of all the people, not just Republicans or anybody else, but all the people, McCain said. I realize that I have to get independents and Democrats if i am going to win this election. He also decried the giant Confederate flag that is been proposed to fly near the intersection of Interstates # and ## in Hills\u00adborough County. McCain has faced this issue before, and has voiced profound regret for not taking a stand against a rebel flag atop the South Carolina statehouse during the #### GOP primary. It's a free country, McCain said of the flag in Hillsborough, but he said the Civil War memorial group behind the flag plans should consider the feelings and sensitivities on this issue at a time like this in America where we want to move forward. Now that the Democratic nominee has been chosen, McCain knows he faces an opponent in Sen. Barack Obama who is more inspiring and energetic on the stump. McCain is not worried. I think people are very interested in substance, as well as style, he said. McCain also struck on a theme of his campaign, suggesting Obama lacks the experience and knowledge to be president. But polls show a strong majority of American voters think invading Iraq was a mistake, which is what Obama said all along. When asked if Obama showed better judgment in opposing the invasion, McCain defended the war as the right call because every intelligence agency in the world believed that (Saddam Hussein) had weapons of mass destruction. What about Florida's Bob Graham, the former Senate Intelligence Committee chairman who argued at the time that invading Iraq would divert attention and resources from more urgent threats, particularly al-Qaida? I respect Sen. Graham enormously, but I do not think there is any doubt that Saddam Hussein, who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before, had invaded a neighbor, Kuwait, where we had to fight one war with him, that his intent was \u2026 to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction, McCain replied. The private fundraising reception at the Renaissance Vinoy Resort in St. Petersburg kicked off a three-day Florida swing, which includes a speech to newspaper editors in Orlando today and an event touting his environmental credentials in the Everglades on Friday. Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton dismissed McCain's efforts to cast himself as anything but a continuation of President Bush's agenda. While John McCain has a record of occasional independence from his party in the past, last year he chose to embrace ## percent of George Bush's agenda, including his failed economic policies and his failed policy in Iraq, Burton said referring to McCain's voting record. No matter how hard he tries to spin it otherwise, that kind of record is simply not the change the American people are looking for or deserve. McCain said he supports the antigay marriage ballot initiatives in Florida and California, even though the Republican governors of both states have little interest in those efforts. While he voted against a federal marriage amendment proposal, McCain noted that he supported a similar initiative in his home state of Arizona, where voters rejected the idea. I think it's important to preserve the unique status of a marriage between men and women, McCain said. I respect the views of others who do not hold that view, but I also think that we have a process in our states to amend our constitutions to reflect the will of the majority of the people. Adam C.

There\u2019s Mitt Romney, the politician, the facet of his personality that most people are familiar with, and of course, Mitt Romney the businessman. There are even the lesser known facets of his life, which include Mitt Romney the family man, and Mitt Romney the Mormon. But how well do you know Mitt Romney the compulsive problem-solver?\n\nThe final paragraph in a recent article in the Washington Post by Kathleen Parker entitled \u201cMitt Romney: A Nice Guy in a Season of Nastiness\u201d provided a moment of epiphany for me, which I\u2019ll share with you at the end of this post. Here\u2019s the paragraph from Parker\u2019s opinion piece that \u201clit the light bulb\u201d over my head:\n\n\u201cThere are stories out there that tell another side to [Romney's] character. Here\u2019s one related to me recently by someone close to the campaign: Romney was shooting an ad on a hot day in a staffer\u2019s yard. While the photo shoot was being set up, Romney was asked to bide time in the cooler shade of the staffer\u2019s garage. When the staffer retrieved Romney ## minutes later, he discovered that the candidate had swept and organized his garage.\u201d\n\nAn anecdote like this sounds pretty far-fetched to anyone who has bought into the snarky premise that Romney is an out-of-touch elitist millionaire who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Yet, when you talk to people who know the Romneys personally, without exception, they describe Romney as the helpful next-door neighbor you never had, but wish you did.\n\nMittFitts.com cartoonist Sal Velluto brought an interesting little video clip of Romney to my attention that illustrates this little-known, yet endearing, facet of Mitt Romney\u2019s personality. The clip shows Gov. Romney at the grand opening of the Florida \u201cTea N Tea Party\u201d headquarters, where he can be seen spending time afterwards mingling with the crowd and allowing folks to get pictures with him. About ## seconds into the video, a gentleman (presumably from NASA) hands Romney a NASA t-shirt, and Romney (who is reportedly worth about $### million dollars) gushes, \u201cFor me? Oh, you\u2019re very kind!\u201d and then he does something quintessentially Romney. While carrying on a conversation with the gentleman, Romney begins to neatly fold the t-shirt with painstaking precision, and once he\u2019s done folding, he hands it off to an aide. The NASA gentleman, seemingly oblivious to the care with which Romney has folded the shirt, snatches it from the aide and unravels it for another photo-op. Romney seems nonplussed, as if he isn\u2019t even consciously aware that he folded it in the first place.\n\nSometimes, this facet of Romney\u2019s personality isn\u2019t so subtle. In July ####, the ##-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital, had disappeared. She had attended a rave party in New York City and gotten high on ecstasy. Three days later, her distraught father had no idea where she was. Romney took immediate action. He closed down the entire firm and asked all ## partners and employees to fly to New York to help find Gay\u2019s daughter. Romney set up a command center at the LaGuardia Marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search. He established a toll-free number for tips, coordinating the effort with the NYPD, and went through his Rolodex and called everyone Bain did business with in New York, and asked them to help find his friend\u2019s missing daughter. Romney\u2019s accountants at Price Waterhouse Cooper put up posters on street poles, while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by Bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper. Romney and the other Bain employees scoured every part of New York and talked with everyone they could \u2013 prostitutes, drug addicts \u2013 anyone.\n\nThat day, their hunt made the evening news, which featured photos of the girl and the Bain employees searching for her. As a result, a teenage boy phoned in, asked if there was a reward, and then hung up abruptly. The NYPD traced the call to a home in New Jersey, where they found the girl in the basement, shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose. Doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day. Romney\u2019s former partner credits Mitt Romney with saving his daughter\u2019s life, saying, \u201cIt was the most amazing thing, and I\u2019ll never forget this to the day I die.\u201d\n\nSo, here\u2019s my epiphany: Mitt Romney simply can\u2019t help himself. He sees a problem, and his mind immediately sets to work solving it, sometimes consciously, and sometimes not-so-consciously. He doesn\u2019t do it for self-aggrandizement, or for personal gain. He does it because that\u2019s just how he\u2019s wired.\n\nMany people are unaware of the fact that when Romney was asked by his old employer, Bill Bain, to come back to Bain & Company as CEO to rescue the firm from bankruptcy, Romney left Bain Capital to work at Bain & Company for an annual salary of one dollar. When Romney went to the rescue of the #### Salt Lake Olympics, he accepted no salary for three years, and wouldn\u2019t use an expense account. He also accepted no salary as Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nFor those who might be tempted to say that Mitt Romney is simply so rich, he doesn\u2019t need the money, consider what just transpired at the Michigan GOP Presidential Debate on November #th. By now, you\u2019ve probably seen video of the painful Rick Perry debate gaffe that has threatened to derail his presidential campaign. During the debate, Perry boldly claimed that he would eliminate three federal departments in order to shrink the size of the federal government. He named two (Education and Commerce) but then, for an excruciatingly awkward ## seconds, he searched his mind for the third, but for the life of him, couldn\u2019t remember what it was. He looked to Ron Paul for help, and Paul grinned and said something to the effect of, \u201cYou should cut five!\u201d\n\nAs Perry continued to squirm and the other candidates watched, someone suggested, \u201cThe EPA?\u201d and Perry leaped at the suggestion, exclaiming, \u201cYeah! There you go, the EPA! No, just kidding\u2026\u201d The moderator then asked, \u201cSeriously? The EPA?\u201d and a deflated Perry admitted with a nervous laugh, \u201cNo, not the EPA.\u201d The Moderator pressed Perry, and Perry said, \u201cNo, EPA needs to be revamped, but it\u2019s Education, uh\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d and from the left, you can hear some say, \u201cCommerce\u201d and Perry repeats, \u201cCommerce\u2026 and uh\u2026 uh\u2026I don\u2019t\u2026 Oops!\u201d\n\nFifteen minutes later, Gov. Perry recalled that the third agency was the Department of Energy.\n\nWho was that helpful voice from off-screen who suggested \u201cEPA\u201d and \u201cCommerce?\u201d The one person who twice tried to toss Perry a life-preserver while he was drowning, while the others just watched him flail? The one candidate who couldn\u2019t help himself, because he\u2019s just wired that way, even though Rick Perry has attacked him at almost every opportunity?\n\nIt was Governor Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy and paste this code to link to this article on your website or blog:\n\nShare this article with a friend:"

The revisions provide more specific guidance to FDIC-supervised institutions to ensure that this high-cost, short-term credit product is not provided repeatedly to customers with longer-term credit needs. There is currently a small number of FDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is issuing the attached revised examination guidance on payday lending programs. The revisions provide more specific guidance with respect to the appropriate limits on payday loan use to ensure that this high-cost, short-term credit product is not provided repeatedly to customers with longer-term credit needs.\n\nPayday loans are small-dollar, unsecured, short-term advances that have high fees relative to the size of the loan. When used frequently or for long periods, the total costs can rapidly exceed the amount borrowed.\n\nThe FDIC initially issued guidance on payday lending in July #### because payday lending is a high-risk activity that presents significant safety and soundness and consumer protection concerns. The FDIC's concerns about payday lending have been heightened as it has observed payday lending conducted in a manner that is inconsistent with the July #### guidance and inconsistent with prudent lending practices. The FDIC believes that providing high-cost, short-term credit on a recurring basis to customers with long-term credit needs is not responsible lending; increases institutions' credit, legal, reputational, and compliance risks; and can create a serious financial hardship for the customer.\n\nTo reduce these risks and promote responsible lending, the revised guidance states that institutions should ensure that payday loans are not provided to customers who have had payday loans outstanding from any lender for a total of three months in the previous ##- month period. When a customer has used payday loans more than three months in the past ## months, institutions should offer the customer, or refer the customer to, an alternative longer-term credit product that more appropriately suits the customer's needs. In any event, whether or not an institution is able to provide a customer alternative credit products, an extension of a payday loan is not appropriate under such circumstances. Other key provisions of the July #### guidance remain unchanged.\n\nFDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending have been instructed to submit plans detailing how they will address the revised guidance. In addition, the FDIC anticipates using a mystery shopper program in conjunction with its examination process of institutions involved in payday lending."

    "text": "Wednesday, August ##, #### at ##:## PM\n\nBeau, I love you. I am so proud of you. Proud of the son you are. Proud of the father you\u2019ve become. And I\u2019m so proud of my son Hunter, my daughter Ashley, and my wife Jill, the only one who leaves me breathless and speechless at the same time.\n\n\n\nIt is an honor to share this stage tonight with President Clinton. And last night, it was moving to watch Hillary, one of the great leaders of our party, a woman who has made history and will continue to make history: my colleague and my friend, Senator Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nAnd I am honored to represent our first state\u2014my state\u2014Delaware.\n\n\n\nSince I\u2019ve never been called a man of few words, let me say this as simply as I can: Yes. Yes, I accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nLet me make this pledge to you right here and now. For every American who is trying to do the right thing, for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our Constitution, no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the English language be: \u201cThe vice president\u2019s office is on the phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarack Obama and I took very different journeys to this destination, but we share a common story. Mine began in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then Wilmington, Delaware. With a dad who fell on hard economic times, but who always told me: \u201cChamp, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.\u201d\n\n\n\nI wish that my dad was here tonight, but I am so grateful that my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, is here. You know, she taught her children\u2014all the children who flocked to our house\u2014that you are defined by your sense of honor, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned.\n\n\n\nFailure at some point in everyone\u2019s life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttered, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldn\u2019t get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day.\n\n\n\nAfter the accident, she told me, \u201cJoey, God sends no cross you cannot bear.\u201d And when I triumphed, she was quick to remind me it was because of others.\n\n\n\nMy mother\u2019s creed is the American creed: No one is better than you. You are everyone\u2019s equal, and everyone is equal to you.\n\n\n\nMy parents taught us to live our faith, and treasure our family. We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they try.\n\n\n\nThat was America\u2019s promise. For those of us who grew up in middle-class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream and we knew it.\n\n\n\nBut today that American dream feels as if it\u2019s slowly slipping away. I don\u2019t need to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up. Almost every night, I take the train home to Wilmington, sometimes very late. As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they\u2019re talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed.\n\n\n\nLike millions of Americans, they\u2019re asking questions as profound as they are ordinary. Questions they never thought they would have to ask:\n\n\n\n* Should mom move in with us now that dad is gone?\n\n* Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars to fill up the car?\n\n* Winter\u2019s coming. How we gonna pay the heating bills?\n\n* Another year and no raise?\n\n* Did you hear the company may be cutting our health care?\n\n* Now, we owe more on the house than it\u2019s worth. How are we going to send the kids to college?\n\n* How are we gonna be able to retire?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the America that George Bush has left us, and that\u2019s the future John McCain will give us. These are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck. These are common stories among middle-class people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays.\n\n\n\nThat promise is the bedrock of America. It defines who we are as a people. And now it\u2019s in jeopardy. I know it. You know it. But John McCain doesn\u2019t get it.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama gets it. Like many of us, Barack worked his way up. His is a great American story.\n\n\n\nYou know, I believe the measure of a man isn\u2019t just the road he\u2019s traveled; it\u2019s the choices he\u2019s made along the way. Barack Obama could have done anything after he graduated from college. With all his talent and promise, he could have written his ticket to Wall Street. But that\u2019s not what he chose to do. He chose to go to Chicago. The South Side. There he met men and women who had lost their jobs. Their neighborhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed. Their dreams deferred. Their dignity shattered. Their self-esteem gone.\n\n\n\nAnd he made their lives the work of his life. That\u2019s what you do when you\u2019ve been raised by a single mom, who worked, went to school and raised two kids on her own. That\u2019s how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a paycheck. It\u2019s dignity. It\u2019s respect. It\u2019s about whether you can look your children in the eye and say: we\u2019re going to be ok.\n\n\n\nBecause Barack made that choice, ###,### more children and parents have health care in Illinois. He fought to make that happen. And because Barack made that choice, working families in Illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work. He got it done.\n\n\n\nAnd when he came to Washington, I watched him hit the ground running, leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. He reached across party lines to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. And he moved Congress and the president to give our wounded veterans the care and dignity they deserve.\n\n\n\nYou can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind, but even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.\n\n\n\nI watched how he touched people, how he inspired them, and I realized he has tapped into the oldest American belief of all: We don\u2019t have to accept a situation we cannot bear.\n\n\n\nWe have the power to change it. That\u2019s Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what he will do for this country. He\u2019ll change it.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain is my friend. We\u2019ve known each other for three decades. We\u2019ve traveled the world together. It\u2019s a friendship that goes beyond politics. And the personal courage and heroism John demonstrated still amaze me.\n\n\n\nBut I profoundly disagree with the direction that John wants to take the country. For example,\n\n\n\nJohn thinks that during the Bush years \u201cwe\u2019ve made great progress economically.\u201d I think it\u2019s been abysmal.\n\n\n\nAnd in the Senate, John sided with President Bush ## percent of the time. Give me a break. When John McCain proposes $### billion in new tax breaks for corporate America, $# billion alone for just eight of the largest companies, but no relief for ### million American families, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nEven today, as oil companies post the biggest profits in history\u2014a half trillion dollars in the last five years\u2014he wants to give them another $# billion in tax breaks. But he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy: solar, wind, biofuels. That\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nMillions of jobs have left our shores, yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there. That\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nHe voted ## times against raising the minimum wage. For people who are struggling just to get to the next day, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nAnd when he says he will continue to spend $## billion a month in Iraq when Iraq is sitting on a surplus of nearly $## billion, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nThe choice in this election is clear. These times require more than a good soldier; they require a wise leader, a leader who can deliver change\u2014the change everybody knows we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will deliver that change. Barack Obama will reform our tax code. He\u2019ll cut taxes for ## percent of the American people who draw a paycheck. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority, creating # million new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama knows that any country that out teaches us today will out-compete us tomorrow. He\u2019ll invest in the next generation of teachers. He\u2019ll make college more affordable. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will bring down health care costs by $#,### for the typical family, and, at long last, deliver affordable, accessible health care for all Americans. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will put more cops on the streets, put the \u201csecurity\u201d back in Social Security and never give up until we achieve equal pay for women. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nAs we gather here tonight, our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out. For the last seven years, this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century: the emergence of Russia, China and India as great powers; the spread of lethal weapons; the shortage of secure supplies of energy, food and water; the challenge of climate change; and the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, we\u2019ve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with Russia\u2019s challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia. Barack Obama and I will end this neglect. We will hold Russia accountable for its actions, and we\u2019ll help the people of Georgia rebuild.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been on the ground in Georgia, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms: this Administration\u2019s policy has been an abject failure. America cannot afford four more years of this.\n\n\n\nNow, despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy, John McCain says Barack Obama isn\u2019t ready to protect our national security. Now, let me ask you: whose judgment should we trust? Should we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he said only three years ago, \u201cAfghanistan\u2014we don\u2019t read about it anymore because it\u2019s succeeded\u201d? Or should we trust Barack Obama, who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan?\n\n\n\nThe fact is, al-Qaida and the Taliban\u2014the people who actually attacked us on #/##\u2014have regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Barack\u2019s call for more troops.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nShould we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he rejected talking with Iran and then asked: What is there to talk about? Or Barack Obama, who said we must talk and make it clear to Iran that its conduct must change.\n\n\n\nNow, after seven years of denial, even the Bush administration recognizes that we should talk to Iran, because that\u2019s the best way to advance our security.\n\n\n\nAgain, John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nShould we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq\u2014that we must stay indefinitely? Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home?\n\n\n\nNow, after six long years, the Bush administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nAgain and again, on the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right.\n\n\n\nFolks, remember when the world used to trust us? When they looked to us for leadership? With Barack Obama as our president, they\u2019ll look to us again, they\u2019ll trust us again, and we\u2019ll be able to lead again.\n\n\n\nJill and I are truly honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey. When I look at their young children\u2014and when I look at my grandchildren\u2014I realize why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here for their future.\n\n\n\nAnd I am here for everyone I grew up with in Scranton and Wilmington. I am here for the cops and firefighters, the teachers and assembly line workers\u2014the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the American dream endures.\n\n\n\nOur greatest presidents\u2014from Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt to John Kennedy\u2014they all challenged us to embrace change. Now, it\u2019s our responsibility to meet that challenge.\n\n\n\nMillions of Americans have been knocked down. And this is the time as Americans, together, we get back up. Our people are too good, our debt to our parents and grandparents too great, our obligation to our children is too sacred.\n\n\n\nThese are extraordinary times. This is an extraordinary election. The American people are ready. I\u2019m ready. Barack Obama is ready. This is his time. This is our time. This is America\u2019s time.\n\n\n\nMay God bless America and protect our troops."

    "text": "The candidates wives were in attendance for the most highly anticipated campaign event to date.\n\nThe presidential race has been dominated so far by negative advertising as both camps try to frame the election to their advantage.\n\nThe first of three presidential debates focused on domestic issues: the economy, health care and the role of government.\n\nRomney, who has been unable to catch the president in most polls to date, sought to generate enthusiasm for a change in the White House.\n\nRomney said Obama has failed to bring down high unemployment and get the economy surging again.\n\nJim Leher of PBS moderates the ##-minute debate on Wednesday. It was the candidates' first time debating face to face.\n\n(CNN) \u2014\n\nThe following is a transcript of Wednesday night\u2019s presidential debate in Denver.\n\n: JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. I\u2019m Jim Lehrer of the \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d and I welcome you to the first of the #### presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.\n\nThis debate and the next three \u2013 two presidential, one vice presidential \u2013 are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight\u2019s ## minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly ##-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.\n\nThousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.\n\nThe segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.\n\nThe audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent \u2013 no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. Let\u2019s start the economy, segment one, and let\u2019s begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?\n\nYou have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.\n\n: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.\n\nThere are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that ## years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.\n\nAnd so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of ## million people.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up.\n\nAnd because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\u2019ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last ## months, we\u2019ve seen # million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.\n\nBut we all know that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\u2019ve been, but where we\u2019re going.\n\nGovernor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\u2019ll be better off. I\u2019ve got a different view.\n\nI think we\u2019ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\u2019s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\u2019re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\u2019re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.\n\nNow, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters \u2013 to you \u2013 which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I\u2019m looking forward to having that debate.\n\n##:  LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.\n\n: FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It\u2019s an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. I\u2019m pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.\n\nAnd congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I\u2019m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here \u2013 here with me. So I\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCongratulations.\n\nThis is obviously a very tender topic. I\u2019ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\u201d\n\nAnn yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \u201cAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\u2019s lost his most recent job and we\u2019ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\u201d\n\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\u2019s going to take a different path. Not the one we\u2019ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do.\n\nMy plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about # million jobs.\n\nNumber two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.\n\nNumber three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\u2019re far away from that now.\n\nNumber four, get to us a balanced budget.\n\nNumber five, champion small business. It\u2019s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a ##-year low.\n\nNow, I\u2019m concerned that the path that we\u2019re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more \u2013 if you will, trickle-down government \u2013 would work.\n\nThat\u2019s not the right answer for America. I\u2019ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.\n\n: LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down \u2013 his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.\n\n: OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in ## states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.\n\nSo now I want to hire another ###,### new math and science teachers, and create # million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.\n\nWhen it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to ## percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.\n\nOn energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.\n\nSo all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?\n\nAnd this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $# trillion tax cut \u2013 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2013 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2013 and $# trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $# trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.\n\n: LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we\u2019re going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.\n\nBut, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you\u2019d like to ask the president directly about something he just said?\n\n: ROMNEY: Well, sure. I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t have a $# trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am.\n\nThe people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $#,###. This is a \u2013 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing.\n\nAt the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $#,### a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.\n\nAnd so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2013 the cornerstones of my plan.\n\nBut the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got ## of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.\n\nThe second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.\n\nThe third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies.\n\nMr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2013 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada.\n\nAnd, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.\n\nAnd finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2013 the revenues going to the government. My \u2013 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.\n\nBut I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2013 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2013 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n: OBAMA: Well, I think \u2013 let\u2019s talk about taxes, because I think it\u2019s instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $#,###.\n\nAnd the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who\u2019s going off to college, which means they\u2019re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.\n\nNow, Governor Romney\u2019s proposal that he has been promoting for ## months calls for a $# trillion tax cut, on top of $# trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he\u2019s been asked over ### times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn\u2019t been able to identify them.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to make an important point here, Jim.\n\n: LEHRER: All right.\n\n: OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can \u2013 are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don\u2019t come close to paying for $# trillion in tax cuts and $# trillion in additional military spending.\n\nOBAMA: And that\u2019s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney\u2019s pledge of not reducing the deficit or \u2013 or \u2013 or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $#,### more.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not my analysis. That\u2019s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And \u2013 and that kind of top \u2013 top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $# million is getting a $###,### tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that\u2019s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.\n\n: LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? Let\u2019s just stay on taxes.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Just \u2013 let\u2019s just stay on taxes for (inaudible).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: What is the difference\u2026\n\n: ROMNEY: Well, but \u2013 but virtually \u2013 virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.\n\n: LEHRER: All right.\n\n: ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I\u2019d say absolutely not. I\u2019m not looking for a $# trillion tax cut. What I\u2019ve said is I won\u2019t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That\u2019s part one. So there\u2019s no economist that can say Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan adds $# trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.\n\nNumber two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it\u2019s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it\u2019s just not the case. Look, I\u2019ve got five boys. I\u2019m used to people saying something that\u2019s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I\u2019ll believe it. But that \u2013 that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.\n\nAnd number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it\u2019s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you\u2019re going to raise taxes by $#,### to $#,### on middle-income families.\n\nThere are all these studies out there. But let\u2019s get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you\u2019d think, well, then why lower the rates.\n\nAnd the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; ## percent of America\u2019s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: LEHRER: That\u2019s where we started. Yeah.\n\nDo you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?\n\n: OBAMA: Well, for ## months he\u2019s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d\n\nAnd the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic.\n\nNow, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for ## percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses ## times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2013 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.\n\nBut I have said that for incomes over $###,### a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created ## million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.\n\nAnd the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.\n\nAnd we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2013 under my plan, ## percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top # percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened.\n\nBut under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2013 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income.\n\nAnd that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.\n\n: LEHRER: All right.\n\n: ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that \u2013 on that point, which is these\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: Just for the \u2013 just for record\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: \u2026 the small businesses we\u2019re talking about\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we\u2019re way over our first ## minutes.\n\n: ROMNEY: It\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\n\n: LEHRER: It\u2019s OK, it\u2019s great. No problem. Well, you all don\u2019t have \u2013 you don\u2019t have a problem, I don\u2019t have a problem, because we\u2019re still on the economy. We\u2019re going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.\n\nOK, but go ahead, sir.\n\n: ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, you\u2019re \u2013 Mr. President, you\u2019re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to ## percent of the businesses are not \u2013 not taxed at the ## percent tax rate, they\u2019re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last # percent of businesses happen to employ half \u2013 half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from ## percent to ## percent.\n\nNow, and \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. He\u2019s in the electronics business in \u2013 in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over ## percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from ## percent to ## percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost ###,### jobs.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there\u2019s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That\u2019s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.\n\n: OBAMA: Jim, I \u2013 you may want to move onto another topic, but I \u2013 I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $# trillion and add $# trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $# trillion \u2013 just to give you a sense, over ## years, that\u2019s more than our entire defense budget \u2013 and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney\u2019s plan may work for you.\n\nBut I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that\u2019s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we\u2019ve tried this. We\u2019ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney\u2019s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in #### and ####, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in ## years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBill Clinton tried the approach that I\u2019m talking about. We created ## million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we\u2019ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they\u2019ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we\u2019re not blowing up the deficit.\n\n: ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: LEHRER: Well, you\u2019re going to get the first word in the next segment.\n\n: ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me \u2013 let me repeat \u2013 let me repeat what I said. I\u2019m not in favor of a $# trillion tax cut. That\u2019s not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That\u2019s point one.\n\nSo you may keep referring to it as a $# trillion tax cut, but that\u2019s not my plan.\n\nNumber two, let\u2019s look at history. My plan is not like anything that\u2019s been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.\n\nMy priority is putting people back to work in America. They\u2019re suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It\u2019s absolutely extraordinary. We\u2019ve got ## million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 when the president took office, ## million people on food stamps; ## million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.\n\nGoing forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.\n\n: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s talk \u2013 we\u2019re still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt.\n\nAnd the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you \u2013 you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?\n\n: ROMNEY: Good. I\u2019m glad you raised that, and it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a critical issue. I think it\u2019s not just an economic issue, I think it\u2019s a moral issue. I think it\u2019s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they\u2019re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.\n\nAnd the amount of debt we\u2019re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.\n\nSo how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they\u2019re paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.\n\nThe presidents would \u2013 president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.\n\nWhat things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don\u2019t pass it: Is the program so critical it\u2019s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I\u2019ll get rid of it. Obamacare\u2019s on my list.\n\nI apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.\n\nOBAMA: I like it.\n\nROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So I\u2019ll get rid of that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Jim, I\u2019m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I\u2019m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, I\u2019ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.\n\nNumber three, I\u2019ll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.\n\nThis is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.\n\nThe president said he\u2019d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The president\u2019s put it in place as much public debt \u2013 almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.\n\n: LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.\n\n: OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.\n\nAnd despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.\n\nSo ## government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, ## government \u2013 ## government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $## billion of waste taken out of the system.\n\nAnd I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nNow, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $# trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.\n\nAnd the way we do it is $#.## for every cut, we ask for $# of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2013 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.\n\nLet \u2013 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $## of spending cuts for just $# of revenue? And he said no.\n\nNow, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: OBAMA: \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a ## percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.\n\n: LEHRER: Mr. President, I\u2019m sorry.\n\n: OBAMA: And \u2013 and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.\n\n: LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.\n\n: OBAMA: Sorry.\n\n: LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n: ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.\n\n: LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n: ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It\u2019s not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.\n\n: OBAMA: That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we\u2019re putting it forward before Congress right now, a $# trillion plan\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But you\u2019ve been \u2013 but you\u2019ve been president four years\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: You\u2019ve been president four years. You said you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. It\u2019s now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we\u2019ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you\u2019re re-elected, we\u2019ll get to a trillion-dollar debt.\n\nI mean, you have said before you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. And this \u2013 I love this idea of $# trillion in cuts. You found $# trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn\u2019t get the job done.\n\nLet me come back and say, why is it that I don\u2019t want to raise taxes? Why don\u2019t I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in ####. You said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we\u2019re in recession, you shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone.\u201d\n\nWell, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don\u2019t want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it\u2019s not just wealthy people \u2013 you mentioned Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just Donald Trump you\u2019re taxing. It\u2019s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.\n\nYou raise taxes and you kill jobs. That\u2019s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill ###,### jobs. I don\u2019t want to kill jobs in this environment.\n\nI\u2019ll make one more point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: LEHRER: (inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment.\n\n: ROMNEY: OK.\n\n: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n: OBAMA: Well, we\u2019ve had this discussion before.\n\n: LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.\n\n: OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He\u2019s ruled out revenue.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: Absolutely. (CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That\u2019s how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you\u2019ll never get there. You\u2019ll never balance the budget by raising taxes.\n\nSpain \u2013 Spain spends ## percent of their total economy on government. We\u2019re now spending ## percent of our economy on government. I don\u2019t want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they\u2019re working.\n\n: LEHRER: But \u2013 but Mr. President, you\u2019re saying in order to \u2013 to get the job done, it\u2019s got to be balanced. You\u2019ve got to have\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: OBAMA: If \u2013 if we\u2019re serious, we\u2019ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.\n\nThe oil industry gets $# billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get.\n\nNow, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.\n\nWhen it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2013 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2013 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.\n\nWell, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\n\nRight now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue.\n\nAnd so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.\n\nIt means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2013 she\u2019s got ## kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are ## years old.\n\nThat is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices.\n\nUltimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.\n\nAnd the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.\n\nAs I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a ## \u2013 a ## percent cut in Medicaid over time.\n\nNow, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem.\n\nAnd governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for ## percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.\n\n: ROMNEY: Jim, let\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve gone on a lot of topics there, and so it\u2019s going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: Come back to\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: \u2026 to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let\u2019s go through them one by one.\n\nFirst of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $#.# billion a year. And it\u2019s actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that\u2019s been in place for a hundred years. Now\u2026\n\nOBAMA: It\u2019s time to end it.\n\nROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $## billion in breaks to the green energy world.\n\nNow, I like green energy as well, but that\u2019s about ## years\u2019 worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $#.# billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.\n\nBut, you know, if we get that tax rate from ## percent down to ## percent, why that $#.# billion is on the table. Of course it\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to ## percent.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, you put $## billion, like ## years\u2019 worth of breaks, into \u2013 into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener#. I mean, I had a friend who said you don\u2019t just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this \u2013 this is not \u2013 this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.\n\nThe second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I\u2019ve been in business for ## years. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.\n\nLEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But \u2013 but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting where I\u2019d like to bring money from overseas back to this country.\n\nAnd, finally, Medicaid to states? I\u2019m not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you\u2019re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus # percent, and then you\u2019re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.\n\nAnd I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors \u2013 Republican and Democrats \u2013 said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.\n\nSo \u2013 so let\u2019s state \u2013 one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don\u2019t have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this.\n\nAnd, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.\n\n: LEHRER: Let\u2019s go.\n\n: ROMNEY: But \u2013 but the right \u2013 the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.\n\n: LEHRER: (inaudible) and we\u2019re going on \u2013 still on the economy, on another \u2013 but another part of it\u2026\n\nOBAMA: OK.\n\n: LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First \u2013 first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?\n\n: OBAMA: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we\u2019ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It\u2019s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker \u2013 Democratic Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill. But it is \u2013 the basic structure is sound.\n\nBut \u2013 but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that\u2019s the big driver of our deficits right now.\n\nYou know, my grandmother \u2013 some of you know \u2013 helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice.\n\nAnd the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the perspective I bring when I think about what\u2019s called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who\u2019ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.\n\nSo my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\u2019re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let\u2019s look where some of the money\u2019s going.\n\n$### billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\u2019t overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $###, and we were also able to make a \u2013 make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the \u2013 throughout the system.\n\nSo the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don\u2019t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.\n\n: LEHRER: We\u2019ll follow up on this.\n\nFirst, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.\n\n: ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something\u2019s going to happen that\u2019s going to change their life for the worse.\n\nAnd the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you\u2019re ## or around ## or older, you don\u2019t need to listen any further.\n\nBut for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\u2019t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\u2019s not.\n\nBut on Medicare, for current retirees, he\u2019s cutting $### billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s saying we\u2019re cutting the rates. Some ## percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\u2019t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.\n\nWe also have ## percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients.\n\nThis \u2013 we have # million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $### billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $### billion for current recipients of Medicare.\n\nNow, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $# \u2013 that\u2019s $# for every $## you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade.\n\nI want to take that $### billion you\u2019ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.\n\nBut the idea of cutting $### billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.\n\nAnd with regards to young people coming along, I\u2019ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.\n\n: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n: OBAMA: First of all, I think it\u2019s important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.\n\nAnd the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It\u2019s called premium support, but it\u2019s understood to be a voucher program. His running mate\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: And you don\u2019t support that?\n\n: OBAMA: I don\u2019t. And let me explain why.\n\n: ROMNEY: Again, that\u2019s for future\u2026\n\n: OBAMA: I understand.\n\n: ROMNEY: \u2026 people, right, not for current retirees.\n\n: OBAMA: For \u2013 so if you\u2019re \u2013 if you\u2019re ## or ##, you might want to listen \u2018cause this \u2013 this will affect you.\n\nThe idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.\n\nThe problem is that because the voucher wouldn\u2019t necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $#,### a year.\n\nNow, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he\u2019ll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there\u2019s still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what\u2019ll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.\n\nAnd then what you\u2019ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own \u2013 only my opinion. AARP thinks that the \u2013 the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \u201cObamacare,\u201d if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $### more in prescription care. They\u2019re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.\n\nAnd the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren\u2019t making seniors any healthier. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.\n\n: LEHRER: We\u2019ll talk about \u2013 specifically about health care in a moment. But what \u2013 do you support the voucher system, Governor?\n\n: ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $### billion out of that program.\n\n: LEHRER: And what about the vouchers?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice.\n\nThey get to choose \u2013 and they\u2019ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don\u2019t have to pay additional money, no additional $#,###. That\u2019s not going to happen. They\u2019ll have at least two plans.\n\nAnd by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they\u2019ll be able to get a private plan.\n\nI know my own view is I\u2019d rather have a private plan. I\u2019d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I\u2019d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don\u2019t like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice.\n\nThe other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we\u2019re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That\u2019s the plan that I\u2019ve put forward.\n\nAnd, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or \u2013 or Senator Wyden, who\u2019s the co-author of the bill with \u2013 with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. This is an idea that\u2019s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.\n\n: OBAMA: Jim, if I \u2013 if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.\n\nAnd private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s what they do. And so you\u2019ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\u2019s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.\n\nAnd when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they\u2019re stuck.\n\nAnd this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that\u2019s why they were supportive of the approach that we took.\n\nOne last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid\u2026 LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.\n\nOBAMA: \u2026 but \u2013 but \u2013 but overall.\n\nLEHRER: OK.\n\nOBAMA: And so\u2026\n\nROMNEY: That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a big topic. Can we \u2013 can we stay on Medicare?\n\nOBAMA: Is that a \u2013 is that a separate topic?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Yeah, we\u2019re going to \u2013 yeah, I want to get to it.\n\nOBAMA: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nLEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 before we leave the economy\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.\n\n: LEHRER: All right.\n\n: ROMNEY: If that\u2019s the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.\n\n: LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.\n\n: ROMNEY: But my experience \u2013 my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.\n\n: LEHRER: All right. Can we \u2013 can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice \u2013 a clear choice between the two\u2026\n\n: ROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 of you on Medicare?\n\nROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n: LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there \u2013 should there be more?\n\nBeginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we\u2019ll go for a few minutes, and then we\u2019re going to go to health care, OK?\n\n: ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can\u2019t have a free market work if you don\u2019t have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have \u2013 I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn\u2019t have people opening up banks in their \u2013 in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.\n\n: LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?\n\n: ROMNEY: In some places, yes. Other places, no.\n\n: LEHRER: Like where?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. And what\u2019s happened with some of the legislation that\u2019s been passed during the president\u2019s term, you\u2019ve seen regulation become excessive, and it\u2019s hurt \u2013 it\u2019s hurt the economy. Let me give you an example.\n\nDodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they\u2019re effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that\u2019s been given to \u2013 to New York banks I\u2019ve ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There\u2019ve been ### community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.\n\nSo there\u2019s one example. Here\u2019s another. In Dodd-Frank\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank?\n\n: ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We\u2019re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: Well, here\u2019s a specific\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: But let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s mention \u2013 let me mention the other one. Let\u2019s talk\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: LEHRER: No, let\u2019s not. Let\u2019s let him respond \u2013 let\u2019s let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.\n\n: OBAMA: I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.\n\nNow, it wasn\u2019t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were \u2013 that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn\u2019t have been given, because the folks didn\u2019t qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\u2019t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A# great investments when they weren\u2019t.\n\nBut you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\u2019t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.\n\nSo what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the ####s. We said you\u2019ve got \u2013 banks, you\u2019ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can\u2019t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We\u2019ve going to make sure that you\u2019ve got to have a living will so \u2013 so we can know how you\u2019re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don\u2019t have other taxpayer bailouts.\n\nIn the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.\n\nNow, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.\n\nAnd, you know, I appreciate and it appears we\u2019ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.\n\nAnd so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that\u2019s not what I believe.\n\n: ROMNEY: Sorry, but that\u2019s just not \u2013 that\u2019s just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That\u2019s why I\u2019d have regulation. But I wouldn\u2019t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That\u2019s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn\u2019t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it\u2019s killing regional and small banks. They\u2019re getting hurt.\n\nLet me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren\u2019t qualified. That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that\u2019s not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn\u2019t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years. We don\u2019t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It\u2019s hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It\u2019s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn\u2019t come out with a clear regulation.\n\nI will make sure we don\u2019t hurt the functioning of our \u2013 of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.\n\n: LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, let\u2019s move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it\u2019s a two-minute new \u2013 new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.\n\nYou want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?\n\n: ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can\u2019t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we\u2019re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can\u2019t afford it.\n\nAnd the number of small businesses I\u2019ve gone to that are saying they\u2019re dropping insurance because they can\u2019t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And \u2013 and we\u2019ve got to deal with cost.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, when \u2013 when \u2013 when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $#,### a year more than traditional insurance. So it\u2019s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $#,### a family. Instead, it\u2019s gone up by that amount. So it\u2019s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t want it.\n\nSecond reason, it cuts $### billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.\n\nNumber three, it puts in place an unelected board that\u2019s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don\u2019t like that idea.\n\nFourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what\u2019s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don\u2019t know how the president could have come into office, facing ## million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the \u2013 at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.\n\nAnd the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let\u2019s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $#,### additional premium.\n\n: LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal?\n\n: OBAMA: Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn\u2019t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn\u2019t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn\u2019t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.\n\nIf they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they\u2019re paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don\u2019t have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they\u2019ve hit the limit.\n\nSo we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.\n\nAnd let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you\u2019ve got health insurance, it doesn\u2019t mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can\u2019t jerk you around. They can\u2019t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance \u2013 your insurance plan until you\u2019re ## years old. And it also says that you\u2019re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.\n\nNumber two, if you don\u2019t have health insurance, we\u2019re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically ## percent lower than if you\u2019re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.\n\nNow, the last point I\u2019d make before\u2026\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes \u2013 two minutes is up, sir.\n\nOBAMA: No, I think \u2013 I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was \u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 the irony is that we\u2019ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasn\u2019t destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.\n\n: LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.\n\nAll right, Governor. Governor, tell \u2013 tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?\n\n: ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary \u2013 elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.\n\nSo entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.\n\nWhat we did in a legislature ## percent Democrat, we worked together; ### legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn\u2019t raise taxes. You\u2019ve raised them by $# trillion under Obamacare. We didn\u2019t cut Medicare. Of course, we don\u2019t have Medicare, but we didn\u2019t cut Medicare by $### billion.\n\nWe didn\u2019t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\u2019re going to receive. We didn\u2019t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put \u2013 put people in a position where they\u2019re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.\n\nRight now, the CBO says up to ## million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said ## percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.\n\nSo for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don\u2019t want Medicare \u2013 don\u2019t want Obamacare. It\u2019s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had \u2013 had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside.\n\nI think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.\n\n: OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.\n\nAnd I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan.\n\nIt \u2013 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?\n\nBecause there \u2013 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line.\n\nOr, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it.\n\nSo at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2013 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with ## tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2013 they\u2019ve engaged in.\n\nNow, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2013 it\u2019s true \u2013 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last ## years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate.\n\nLet me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2013 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at ## million people losing health insurance\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\n: OBAMA: \u2026 at a time when it\u2019s vitally important.\n\n: LEHRER: Let\u2019s let the governor explain what you would do\u2026\n\n: ROMNEY: Well\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: \u2026 if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: ROMNEY: Well, actually it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.\n\nBut let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nIn my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2013 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.\n\nYour example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.\n\nThis is the private market. These are small \u2013 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2013 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.\n\nIn order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of ## people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.\n\nBut the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.\n\nThat\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.\n\n: OBAMA: Let me just point out first of all this board that we\u2019re talking about can\u2019t make decisions about what treatments are given. That\u2019s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\u2019s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nWell, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2013 if it\u2019s been under ## days.\n\nBut that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d\n\nNow, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2013 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.\n\nIt just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry.\n\nAnd at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2013 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?\n\nNo. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.\n\n: LEHRER: We\u2019re going to move to\u2026\n\n: ROMNEY: No. I \u2013 I have to respond to that.\n\n: LEHRER: No, but\u2026\n\n: ROMNEY: Which is \u2013 which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and \u2013 and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \u201cIt\u2019s my way or the highway,\u201d I don\u2019t get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O\u2019Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You\u2019ve said the same thing, you\u2019re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.\n\nThose are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I\u2019m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what \u2013 what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $##,###, $##,###. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2013 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time.\n\nThe federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the ##th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.\n\n: LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And \u2013 and let\u2019s see. Role of government. And it is \u2013 you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you \u2013 but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President \u2013 do you believe there\u2019s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?\n\n: OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.\n\n: LEHRER: And do you \u2013 yeah.\n\n: OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That\u2019s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I\u2019ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\u2019ve been in the Oval Office.\n\nBut I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.\n\nLook, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.\n\nBut as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let\u2019s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let\u2019s start the National Academy of Sciences, let\u2019s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we\u2019re all going to be better off. That doesn\u2019t restrict people\u2019s freedom. That enhances it.\n\nAnd so what I\u2019ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.\n\nAnd when it comes to education what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn\u2019t a top-down approach, Governor. What we\u2019ve said is to states, we\u2019ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had ## states around the country who have made a real difference.\n\nBut what I\u2019ve also said is let\u2019s hire another ###,### math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can\u2019t all do that. In fact we\u2019ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn\u2019t think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.\n\nIt can\u2019t do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we\u2019ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\u2019ve got a skilled workforce.\n\n: LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?\n\n: ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all ## states. And the key to great schools, great teachers.\n\nSo I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.\n\nThe role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.\n\nFirst, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military.\n\nSecond, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2013 by one another.\n\nWe\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2013 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.\n\nBut we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2013 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working.\n\nAnd the proof of that is ## million people out of work. The proof of that is # out of # people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from ## million on food stamps to ## million on food stamps. The proof of that is that ## percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work.\n\n: LEHRER: All right.\n\n: ROMNEY: We know that the path we\u2019re taking is not working. It\u2019s time for a new path.\n\n: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s go through some specifics in terms of what \u2013 how each of you views the role of government. How do \u2013 education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?\n\n: ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is \u2013 is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I \u2013 and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he\u2019s \u2013 some ideas he\u2019s put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and \u2013 and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and \u2013 and state schools to do a better job.\n\nMy own view, by the way, is I\u2019ve added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I \u2013 these are disabled kids or \u2013 or \u2013 or poor kids or \u2013 or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.\n\nSo all federal funds, instead of going to the \u2013 to the state or to the school district, I\u2019d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their \u2013 their \u2013 their student.\n\n: LEHRER: How do you see the federal government\u2019s responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?\n\n: OBAMA: Well, as I\u2019ve indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we\u2019ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they\u2019re having an impact right now.\n\n: LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and \u2013 and those of Governor Romney on \u2013 about education and the federal government?\n\n: OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we\u2019re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.\n\nYou know, his \u2013 his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney\u2019s talked about. And it wasn\u2019t very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But \u2013 but what it did do is to \u2013 if you extrapolated how much money we\u2019re talking about, you\u2019d look at cutting the education budget by up to ## percent.\n\nWhen it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they\u2019re setting up their training programs\u2026\n\n: LEHRER: Do you \u2013 do you agree, Governor?\n\n: OBAMA: Let me just finish the point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: OBAMA: The \u2013 where they\u2019re partnering so that they\u2019re designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that there\u2019s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.\n\nLet me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $## billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.\n\nAnd we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.\n\nGovernor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \u201cyou should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\u201d you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\u2019t have that option.\n\nAnd for us to be able to make sure that they\u2019ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow this economy over the long term.\n\n: LEHRER: We\u2019re running out of time, gentlemen.\n\n(CROSSTALK) LEHRER: Governor?\n\n: ROMNEY: Mr. President, Mr. President, you\u2019re entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I\u2019m not going to cut education funding. I don\u2019t have any plan to cut education funding and \u2013 and grants that go to people going to college. I\u2019m planning on (inaudible) to grow. So I\u2019m not planning on making changes there.\n\nBut you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $## billion into \u2013 into green jobs. And I \u2013 look, I\u2019m all in favor of green energy. $## billion, that would have \u2013 that would have hired # million teachers. $## billion.\n\nAnd these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.\n\nLook, the right course for America\u2019s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.\n\nThe right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a \u2013 to a school that he\u2019s being more successful.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\u2019ve had that experience. I don\u2019t just talk about it. I\u2019ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\u2019t have commitment to education. It\u2019s because I care about education for all of our kids.\n\n: LEHRER: All right, gentlemen\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n: LEHRER: Excuse me (inaudible). Excuse me, sir. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 barely have three minutes left. I\u2019m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I\u2019ve done a poor job.\n\nOBAMA: You\u2019ve done a great job.\n\nLEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government \u2013 the role of government and governing, we\u2019ve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three \u2013 three minutes left in the \u2013 in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we\u2019ve got three minutes total time here \u2013 and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that?\n\nGovernor?\n\n: ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like it at the time \u2013 of being elected in a state where my legislature was ## percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes ## times.\n\n: LEHRER: But what would you do as president?\n\n: ROMNEY: We \u2013 as president, I will sit on day one \u2013 actually, the day after I get elected \u2013 I\u2019ll sit down with leaders \u2013 the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue \u2013 as we did in my state \u2013 we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the \u2013 in the \u2013 in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we\u2019re going to compromise our principle, but because there\u2019s common ground.\n\nAnd the challenges America faces right now \u2013 look, the reason I\u2019m in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face \u2013 this deficit could crush the future generations. What\u2019s happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.\n\n: LEHRER: All right.\n\n: ROMNEY: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership \u2013 leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if \u2013 if it\u2019s a Republican or a Democrat. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ll do it again.\n\n: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n: OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney\u2019s going to have a busy first day, because he\u2019s also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you\u2019re sitting down with them.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they\u2019re advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause. That\u2019s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That\u2019s how we repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask/don\u2019t tell.\u201d That\u2019s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That\u2019s how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.\n\nSo we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \u201cI\u2019ll sit down,\u201d but you have to have a plan.\n\nNumber two, what\u2019s important is occasionally you\u2019ve got to say no, to \u2013 to \u2013 to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when \u2013 when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.\n\nWhen \u2013 when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.\n\nLEHRER: All right\n\nOBAMA: And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\n\n: LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.\n\n: OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.\n\nYou know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at ## to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\u2019s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\u2019t lay off workers during a recession.\n\nThe auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\u2019re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that I\u2019ve tried to do, and everything that I\u2019m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\u2019re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.\n\nAll those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is \u2013 is channeled and \u2013 and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair shot. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair share \u2013 everybody\u2019s doing a fair share, and everybody\u2019s playing by the same rules.\n\nYou know, four years ago, I said that I\u2019m not a perfect man and I wouldn\u2019t be a perfect president. And that\u2019s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I\u2019ve kept. But I also promised that I\u2019d fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. I\u2019ve kept that promise and if you\u2019ll vote for me, then I promise I\u2019ll fight just as hard in a second term.\n\n: LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.\n\n: ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.\n\nThis is a \u2013 this is an important election and I\u2019m concerned about America. I\u2019m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.\n\nI \u2013 I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\u2019s bigger than our respective parties. It\u2019s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.\n\nAnd there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\u2019re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\u2019re talk about those two paths.\n\nBut they lead in very different directions. And it\u2019s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record.\n\nThere\u2019s no question in my mind that if the president were to be re-elected you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.\n\nI\u2019ll get incomes up again.\n\nYou\u2019ll see chronic unemployment. We\u2019ve had ## straight months with unemployment above # percent.\n\nIf I\u2019m president I will create \u2013 help create ## million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.\n\nIf the president\u2019s re-elected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\u2019s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\u2019re going to see health premiums go up by some $#,### per family.\n\nIf I\u2019m elected we won\u2019t have Obama. We\u2019ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\u2019ll focus on getting the cost of health care down.\n\nIf the president were to be re-elected you\u2019re going to see a $### billion cut to Medicare. You\u2019ll have # million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\u2019ll have hospital and providers that\u2019ll no longer accept Medicare patients.\n\nI\u2019ll restore that $### billion to Medicare.\n\nAnd finally, military. The president\u2019s re-elected you\u2019ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.\n\nI will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America\u2019s middle class working again.\n\nThank you, Jim.\n\nLEHRER: Thank you, Governor.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October ##th at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I\u2019m Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.\n\n(APPLAUSE)"

It\u2019s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is good to be back.\n\n\n\nI want to, first of all, thank Knox College -- (applause) -- I want to thank Knox College and your president, Teresa Amott, for having me here today. Give Teresa a big round of applause. (Applause.) I want to thank your Congresswoman, Cheri Bustos, who\u2019s here. (Applause.) we have got Governor Quinn here. (Applause.) i am told we have got your Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Simon, is here. (Applause.) There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nI see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I have not seen in years and i am looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular i have got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate -- John Sullivan is in the house. (Applause.) John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because he\u2019s got, like, ## brothers and sisters, and his wife has got ## brothers and sisters -- (laughter) -- so they\u2019ve got this entire precinct just in their family. (Laughter.) And they all look like John -- the brothers do -- so he doesn\u2019t have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. (Laughter.) It is good to see him.\n\n\n\nDick Durbin couldn\u2019t make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. (Applause.) He\u2019s doing a great job. And we\u2019ve got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because we\u2019re going to Missouri later this afternoon. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd all of you are here, and it\u2019s great to see you. (Applause.) And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nSo, eight years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of ####. Things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair -- (laughter) -- or a motorcade. Didn\u2019t even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech because the printer didn\u2019t work here and we had to drive it in from somewhere. (Laughter.) But it was my first big speech as your newest senator.\n\n\n\nAnd on the way here I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was, one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago, and how much it represented what\u2019s best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class -- and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the ##st century.\n\n\n\nSee, I had just spent a year traveling the state and listening to your stories -- of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico. (Applause.) A lot of folks here remember that. Of teachers whose salaries weren\u2019t keeping up with the rising cost of groceries. (Applause.) Of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed.\n\n\n\nIn the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company, or swept its floors, or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain -- a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids.\n\n\n\nBut over time, that engine began to stall -- and a lot of folks here saw it -- that bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor.\n\n\n\nAnd so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and people\u2019s wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top # percent nearly quadrupled from #### to ####, but the typical family\u2019s incomes barely budged.\n\n\n\nAnd towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in #### as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place -- the erosion of middle-class security -- was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see.\n\n\n\nNow, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back. (Applause.) We fought our way back. Together, we saved the auto industry; took on a broken health care system. (Applause.) We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. (Applause.) Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks, and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. (Applause.) We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families -- so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for ## percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo you add it all up, and over the past ## months, our businesses have created #.# million new jobs. This year, we\u2019re off to our strongest private sector job growth since ####.\n\n\n\nAnd because we bet on this country, suddenly foreign companies are, too. Right now, more of Honda\u2019s cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. (Applause.) Airbus, the European aircraft company, they\u2019re building new planes in Alabama. (Applause.) And American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing -- they\u2019re bringing jobs back home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We\u2019re about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly ## years. (Applause.) The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in ## years. (Applause.) And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in ## years. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- we\u2019ve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter.\n\n\n\nAs a country, we\u2019ve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we are actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long, and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.\n\n\n\nBut -- and here's the big \u201cbut\u201d -- I\u2019m here to tell you today that we are not there yet. We all know that. we are not there yet. we have got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past ## years have continued to flow to the top # percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly ## percent since ####. The average American earns less than he or she did in ####. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those who\u2019ve been out of work for some time.\n\n\n\nToday, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families haven\u2019t seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their ###(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how they\u2019re going to be able to retire.\n\n\n\nSo in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in #### -- eight years ago -- the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water -- those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that is a problem.\n\n\n\nThis growing inequality not just of result, inequality of opportunity -- this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, it\u2019s bad economics. Because when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America -- that idea that if you work hard you can make it here.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why reversing these trends has to be Washington\u2019s highest priority. (Applause.) It has to be Washington's highest priority. (Applause.) It\u2019s certainly my highest priority. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, over the past couple of years, in particular, Washington hasn\u2019t just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd I have to say that -- because i am looking around the room -- i have got some friends here not just who are Democrats, i have got some friends here who are Republicans -- (applause) -- and I worked with in the state legislature and they did great work. But right now, what we\u2019ve got in Washington, we have seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldn\u2019t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in #### and we cannot afford to repeat that.\n\n\n\nThen, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel -- by cutting out programs we don\u2019t need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making government more efficient -- instead of doing that, we have got folks who\u2019ve insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that is cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAlmost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we are underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs.\n\n\n\nThen, over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I did not think that was possible. (Laughter.) The good news is a growing number of Republican senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts and try to get things done in the Senate. So that is good news. (Applause.) For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work.\n\n\n\nBut you have got a faction of Republicans in the House who won\u2019t even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that America\u2019s farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo --\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And if you ask some of these folks, some of these folks mostly in the House, about their economic agenda how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, they\u2019ll shift the topic to \u201cout-of-control government spending\u201d \u2013- despite the fact that we have cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nOr they\u2019ll talk about government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that they\u2019ve already cut early education for vulnerable kids. they have already cut insurance for people who\u2019ve lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or they\u2019ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My daughter has insurance now!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Applause.) That\u2019s what this is about. That\u2019s what this is about. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we have been fighting for.\n\n\n\nBut with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. (Applause.) This needs to stop.\n\n\n\nThis moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. That\u2019s what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. That\u2019s why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need to be talking about. That\u2019s what Washington needs to be focused on.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. (Applause.) i will lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. (Applause.) A secure retirement even if you\u2019re not rich. Reducing poverty. Reducing inequality. Growing opportunity. That\u2019s what we need. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we need. That\u2019s what we need right now. That\u2019s what we need to be focused on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, some of these ideas I\u2019ve talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. (Applause.) Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan; we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, of course, we\u2019ll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against al Qaeda. (Applause.) We need to combat climate change. We\u2019ve got to standing up for civil rights. We\u2019ve got to stand up for women\u2019s rights. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo all those issues are important, and we\u2019ll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we don\u2019t have a growing, thriving middle class then we won\u2019t have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We won\u2019t have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues.\n\n\n\nNow, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand what\u2019s at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock, or inaction, or willful indifference to get in our way. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThat means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I\u2019ll use it. (Applause.) Where I can\u2019t act on my own and Congress isn\u2019t cooperating, I\u2019ll pick up the phone -- I\u2019ll call CEOs; I\u2019ll call philanthropists; I\u2019ll call college presidents; I\u2019ll call labor leaders. I\u2019ll call anybody who can help -- and enlist them in our efforts. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the ##st century. And it will lay the foundation for our children\u2019s future, our grandchildren\u2019s future, for all Americans.\n\nSo let me give you a quick preview of what I\u2019ll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. that is how this area was built. that is how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.\n\n\n\nNow, over the past four years, for the first time since the ####s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. that is the good news. (Applause.) But we can do more. So I\u2019m going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. (Applause.) We\u2019re going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our tax code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe want to make sure that -- we\u2019re going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here -- I\u2019m going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So let\u2019s tell the world that America is open for business. (Applause.) I know there\u2019s an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- let\u2019s put some folks to work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came -- backstage -- Pat Quinn -- he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. (Applause.) But we\u2019ve got work to do all across the country. We\u2019ve got ports that aren\u2019t ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in two years\u2019 time. If we don\u2019t get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. We\u2019ve got more than ###,### bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nBusinesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that can\u2019t be outsourced. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, this isn\u2019t a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff -- first Republican President. (Applause.) And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And that\u2019s inefficient at a time when it\u2019s as cheap as it\u2019s been since the ####s to build things. It\u2019s inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.\n\n\n\nThe longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. They\u2019ll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because we\u2019ll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the United States. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIn an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and they\u2019ll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- they\u2019ll reward those folks with good pay.\n\n\n\nThe days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didn\u2019t need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, they\u2019re not going away. Those old days aren\u2019t coming back.\n\n\n\nSo we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win. That\u2019s what we have to do. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class -- and everybody here knows it -- an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that they\u2019re going to face. (Applause.) And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the ##st century. (Laughter and applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we don\u2019t make this investment, we\u2019re going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every #-year-old in America. (Applause.) Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that don\u2019t require Congress. (Applause.) So, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect ## percent of America\u2019s students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. We\u2019re making that happen right now. (Applause.) We\u2019ve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019re also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. (Applause.) And while it didn\u2019t pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked Congress to start a Community College to Career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. (Applause.) And I\u2019m going to challenge CEOs from some of America\u2019s best companies to hire more Americans who\u2019ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 an honest look.\n\n\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: More talent!\n\n\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That, too.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that\u2019s straining the budgets of just about every American family -- and that\u2019s the soaring cost of higher education. (Applause.) Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. (Laughter.)\n\n\n\nThree years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college. (Applause.) Then, I capped loan repayments at ## percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didn\u2019t pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than ## percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. That\u2019s in place right now. (Applause.) And this week, we\u2019re working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo this is all a good start -- but it isn\u2019t enough. Families and taxpayers can\u2019t just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. We\u2019ll never have enough loan money, we\u2019ll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up #, #, # percent a year. We\u2019ve got to get more out of what we pay for.\n\n\n\nNow, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some states, they\u2019re testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.\n\n\n\nSo this afternoon, I\u2019ll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American who\u2019s willing to work for it. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, so you\u2019ve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security. For most families, that\u2019s your biggest asset. For most families, that\u2019s where your life\u2019s work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is over the past four years, we\u2019ve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019re not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isn\u2019t based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.\n\n\n\nSo already, I\u2019ve asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt Romney\u2019s economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. (Applause.) It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. We\u2019ll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and build a housing finance system that\u2019s rock-solid for future generations.\n\n\n\nSo we\u2019ve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. (Applause.) I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. It\u2019s getting farther and farther away. They cannot see it.\n\n\n\nNow, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they will not be able to retire. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say they don\u2019t have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nGood job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.\n\n\n\nFifth, i am going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you\u2019ve worked a lifetime to build.\n\n\n\nAs we speak, we are well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) we are going to implement it. Now, if you\u2019re one of the ## percent of Americans who already have health insurance either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you don\u2019t have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you are on Medicare -- that\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act means. you are already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have health insurance, then starting on October #st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you will be able to comparison-shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like you\u2019d buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you are doing online, and you will be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.\n\n\n\nAnd if you are one of the up to half of all Americans who\u2019ve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning January #st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. (Applause.) That\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act does. That\u2019s what it does. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nNow, look, I know because i have been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. And I don\u2019t always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who don\u2019t have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that\u2019s a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.\n\n\n\nSo just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least ## percent lower than what they are paying today -- ## percent lower. (Applause.) So folks' premiums in the individual market will drop by ## percent. And for them and for the millions of Americans who\u2019ve been able to cover their sick kids for the first time -- like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance -- or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply, or are able to have their kids who are younger than -- who are ## or ## stay on their parents' plan -- (applause) -- for all those folks, you will have the security of knowing that everything you\u2019ve worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nFinally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle-class security -- good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security -- I\u2019m going to make the case for why we have got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those Americans who have not quite made it yet -- who are working hard but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty. Here in America, we\u2019ve never guaranteed success -- that is not what we do. More than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant. Nobody is going to do something for you. (Applause.) we have tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy. that is all for the good. But that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility -- the idea that no matter how poor you started, if you are willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it, too. that is the American idea. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in America have gotten harder to find over the past ## years. And that\u2019s a betrayal of the American idea. And that\u2019s why we have to do a lot more to give every American the chance to work their way into the middle class.\n\n\n\nThe best defense against all of these forces -- global competition, economic polarization -- is the strength of the community. So we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods. (Applause.) We need new partnerships with some of the hardest-hit towns in America to get them back on their feet. And because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. It's time for the minimum wage to go up. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nwe are not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life\u2019s biggest winners or losers. And after years in which we\u2019ve seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times -- folks in Galesburg, folks in the Quad Cities, you know there are good people who work hard and sometimes they get a bad break. A plant leaves. Somebody gets sick. Somebody loses a home. we have seen it in our family, in our friends and our neighbors. we have seen it happen. And that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens.\n\n\n\nSo good jobs; a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class; an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down -- that is where I will focus my energies. (Applause.) that is where I will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.\n\n\n\nThese are the plans that i will lay out across this country. But I won\u2019t be able to do it alone, so i am going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause. We\u2019ll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure Congress to invest in our future. And I\u2019ll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees. And I\u2019m going to highlight the ones that do just that.\n\n\n\nThere are companies like Costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits. (Applause.) Companies like -- there are companies like the Container Store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction -- because these companies prove that it\u2019s not just good for the employees, it\u2019s good for their businesses to treat workers well. It\u2019s good for America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019m going to be calling on the private sector to step up. I will be saying to Democrats we\u2019ve got to question some of our old assumptions. We\u2019ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that do not work as well as they should. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to be willing to -- we\u2019ve got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age. We cannot just -- Democrats cannot just stand pat and just defend whatever government is doing. If we believe that government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century -- and I believe that -- we\u2019ve an obligation to prove it. And that means that we\u2019ve got to be open to new ways of doing things.\n\n\n\nAnd we\u2019ll need Republicans in Congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, in the run-up to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, Mr. President, these are all good ideas, but some of you\u2019ve said before; some of them sound great, but you cannot get those through Congress. Republicans won\u2019t agree with you. And I say, look, the fact is there are Republicans in Congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas I\u2019ll be proposing. I know because they\u2019ve said so. But they worry they\u2019ll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me.\n\n\n\nNow, there are others who will dismiss every idea I put forward either because they\u2019re playing to their most strident supporters, or in some cases because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for America -- one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families; and government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can.\n\n\n\nIn either case, I say to these members of Congress: I\u2019m laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. So now it\u2019s time for you to lay out your ideas. (Applause.) You cannot just be against something. You got to be for something. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEven if you think I\u2019ve done everything wrong, the trends I just talked about were happening well before I took office. So it\u2019s not enough for you just to oppose me. You got to be for something. What are your ideas? If you\u2019re willing to work with me to strengthen American manufacturing and rebuild this country\u2019s infrastructure, let\u2019s go. If you\u2019ve got better ideas to bring down the cost of college for working families, let\u2019s hear them. If you think you have a better plan for making sure that every American has the security of quality, affordable health care, then stop taking meaningless repeal votes, and share your concrete ideas with the country. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nRepealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It\u2019s not.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces the mindless cuts currently in place, or if you\u2019re interested in tax reform that closes corporate loopholes and gives working families a better deal, I\u2019m ready to work. (Applause.) But you should know that I will not accept deals that don\u2019t meet the basic test of strengthening the prospects of hardworking families. This is the agenda we have to be working on. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since I first took office. (Applause.) As a country, we\u2019re older and wiser. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wiser, but I\u2019m certainly older. (Laughter.) And as long as Congress doesn\u2019t manufacture another crisis -- as long as we don\u2019t shut down the government just because I\u2019m for keeping it open -- (laughter) -- as long as we don\u2019t risk a U.S. default over paying bills that we\u2019ve already racked up, something that we\u2019ve never done -- we can probably muddle along without taking bold action. If we stand pat and we don\u2019t do any of the things I talked about, our economy will grow, although slower than it should. New businesses will form. The unemployment rate will probably tick down a little bit. Just by virtue of our size and our natural resources and, most of all, because of the talent of our people, America will remain a world power, and the majority of us will figure out how to get by.\n\n\n\nBut you know what, that\u2019s our choice. If we just stand by and do nothing in the face of immense change, understand that part of our character will be lost. Our founding precepts about wide-open opportunity, each generation doing better than the last -- that will be a myth, not reality. The position of the middle class will erode further. Inequality will continue to increase. Money\u2019s power will distort our politics even more.\n\n\n\nSocial tensions will rise, as various groups fight to hold on to what they have, or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn\u2019t improving. And the fundamental optimism that\u2019s always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the vision I have for this country. It\u2019s not the vision you have for this country. That\u2019s not the America we know. That\u2019s not the vision we should be settling for. That\u2019s not a vision we should be passing on to our children.\n\n\n\nI have now run my last campaign. I do not intend to wait until the next campaign or the next President before tackling the issues that matter. I care about one thing and one thing only, and that\u2019s how to use every minute -- (applause) -- the only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining #,### days of my term -- (laughter) -- to make this country work for working Americans again. (Applause.) That\u2019s all I care about. I don\u2019t have another election. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nBecause I\u2019ll tell you, Galesburg, that\u2019s where I believe America needs to go. I believe that\u2019s where the American people want to go. And it may seem hard today, but if we\u2019re willing to take a few bold steps -- if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we\u2019ve just seen for way too long -- if we just make some common-sense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now. It will be stronger five years from now. It will be stronger ## years from now. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nIf we focus on what matters, then more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will have the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \u201cOpen\u201d on their own business. More Americans will have the joy of scratching the height of their kid on that door of their brand-new home. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nAnd in the end, is not that what makes us special? It's not the ability to generate incredible wealth for the few; it's our ability to give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness. (Applause.) We haven\u2019t just wanted success for ourselves -- we want it for our neighbors, too. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nWhen we think about our own communities -- we are not a mean people; we are not a selfish people; we are not a people that just looks out for \u201cnumber one.\u201d Why should our politics reflect those kinds of values? That\u2019s why we don\u2019t call it John\u2019s dream or Susie\u2019s dream or Barack\u2019s dream or Pat's dream -- we call it the American Dream. And that\u2019s what makes this country special -- the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can make it if you try. (Applause.) That\u2019s what we are fighting for.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, Congress is tough right now, but that\u2019s not going to stop me. we are going to do everything we can, wherever we can, with or without Congress, to make things happen. we are going to go on the road and talk to you, and you will have ideas, and we want to see which ones we can implement. But we are going to focus on this thing that matters.\n\n\n\nOne of America\u2019s greatest writers, Carl Sandburg, born right here in Galesburg over a century ago -- (applause) -- he saw the railroads bring the world to the prairie, and then the prairie sent out its bounty to the world. And he saw the advent of new industries, new technologies, and he watched populations shift. He saw fortunes made and lost. And he saw how change could be painful -- how a new age could unsettle long-held customs and ways of life. But he had that frontier optimism, and so he saw something more on the horizon. And he wrote, \u201cI speak of new cities and new people. The past is a bucket of ashes. Yesterday is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west. There is only an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, America, we\u2019ve made it through the worst of yesterday\u2019s winds. We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward. we have got to set our eyes on the horizon. We will find an ocean of tomorrows. We will find a sky of tomorrows for the American people and for this great country that we love.\n\n\n\nSo thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\n\n\nEND\n\n#:## P.M. CDT"

MCCAIN AND OBAMA PARTICIPATE IN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES DEBATE, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY, HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK\n\nSPEAKERS:\n\n\n\nU.S. SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN (AZ)\n\nREPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE\n\n\n\nU. S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL)\n\nDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE\n\n\n\n\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER, MODERATOR\n\n[*] SCHIEFFER: Good evening. And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of ####, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. i am Bob Schieffer of CBS News.\n\nThe rules tonight are simple. The subject is domestic policy. I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.\n\nI will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we will have a discussion.\n\ni will encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.\n\nThe audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGentlemen, welcome.\n\nBy now, we have heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they have not heard. Let's get to it.\n\nAnother very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.\n\nSenator McCain, you proposed a $## billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.\n\nSenator Obama, you proposed $## billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.\n\nI will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?\n\nSenator McCain, you go first.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.\n\nAnd thanks to Hofstra.\n\nAnd, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.\n\nIt's good to see you again, Senator Obama.\n\nAmericans are hurting right now, and they are angry. they are hurting, and they are angry. they are innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they are angry, and they have every reason to be angry.\n\nAnd they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I will not repeat.\n\nBut we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.\n\nLet me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.\n\nThe catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.\n\nI am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.\n\nNow, we have allocated $### billion. Let's take ### of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, ## million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.\n\nNow, I know the criticism of this.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It does not help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned. And so we have got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Senator Obama?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.\n\nI think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they are putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.\n\nAnd I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out. But what we have not yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So i have proposed four specific things that I think can help.\n\nNumber one, let's focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that is creating a job right here in America.\n\nNumber two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $###,###, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they are experiencing a crisis.\n\nNow Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we have got to help homeowners. that is why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.\n\nI disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we are buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we do not want to waste taxpayer money. And we have got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.\n\nLast point I want to make, though. we have got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. we have got to fix our energy policy that is giving our wealth away. we have got to fix our health care system and we have got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Would you like to ask him a question?\n\nMCCAIN: No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.\n\nJoe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked ##, ## hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.\n\nYou were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.\n\nNow Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, i will not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and i will keep your taxes low and i will provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.\n\nAnd I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. that is ## million jobs in America. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Is that what you want to do?\n\nMCCAIN: that is what Joe believes.\n\nOBAMA: He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's. Let me tell you what i am actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.\n\nNow, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $### billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $# billion in tax breaks.\n\nWhat i have said is I want to provide a tax cut for ## percent of working Americans, ## percent. If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. And ## percent of working families, ## percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.\n\nOBAMA: Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\n\nAnd what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who does not yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices.\n\nThe last point i will make about small businesses. Not only do ## percent of small businesses make less than $###,###, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs.\n\nMCCAIN: You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around. In other words, we are going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.\n\nI want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around. You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.\n\nThe whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around. I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we are talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.\n\nWho -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now? Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.\n\ni am not going to...\n\nOBAMA: OK. Can I...\n\nMCCAIN: we are not going to do that in my administration.\n\nOBAMA: If I can answer the question. Number one, I want to cut taxes for ## percent of Americans. Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...\n\nMCCAIN: we are talking about Joe the plumber. OBAMA: ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $###,###.\n\nThen Exxon Mobil, which made $## billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they are trying to figure out how they are going to afford food, how they are going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.\n\nSo, look, nobody likes taxes. I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. But ultimately, we have got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.\n\nMCCAIN: Nobody likes taxes. Let's not raise anybody's taxes. OK?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I do not mind paying a little more.\n\nMCCAIN: The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world. Our tax rate for business in America is ## percent. Ireland, it's ## percent.\n\nWhere are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?\n\nWe need to cut the business tax rate in America. We need to encourage business.\n\nNow, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes. We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's go to another topic. It's related. So if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that.\n\nThis question goes to you first, Senator Obama.\n\nWe found out yesterday that this year's deficit will reach an astounding record high $### billion. Some experts say it could go to $# trillion next year.\n\nBoth of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $### billion to the deficit.\n\nare not you both ignoring reality? will not some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated?\n\nGive us some specifics on what you are going to cut back.\n\nSenator Obama?\n\nOBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $### billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that is important to understand.\n\nBut there is no doubt that we have been living beyond our means and we are going to have to make some adjustments.\n\nNow, what i have done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut. I have not made a promise about...\n\nSCHIEFFER: But you are going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly.\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely. So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that i have proposed, i have proposed an additional cut so that it matches.\n\nOBAMA: And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $## billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It does not -- under the Medicare plan -- it does not help seniors get any better. It's not improving our health care system. It's just a giveaway.\n\nWe need to eliminate a whole host of programs that do not work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that do not work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better.\n\nNow, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier.\n\nIf we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.\n\nIf we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we are borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.\n\nIf we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the ##st century.\n\nBut what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we are not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.\n\nAnd we are going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nSenator?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you, Bob. I just want to get back to this home ownership. During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.\n\nAnd they went out and bought up these mortgages. And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money. And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago.\n\nSo, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.\n\nSCHIEFFER: But what...\n\nMCCAIN: But -- OK. All right.\n\nSCHIEFFER: The question was, what are you going to cut?\n\nMCCAIN: Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence. We have to have nuclear power. We have to stop sending $### billion a year to countries that do not like us very much. It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.\n\nAnd the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.\n\nOK, what -- what would I cut? I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK? Some people say that is a hatchet. that is a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?\n\nBecause we have got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we have got to have a new direction for this country. We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.\n\nGovernment spending has gone completely out of control; $## trillion dollar debt we are giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.\n\nI know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Which ones?\n\nMCCAIN: I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.\n\nI oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.\n\nI would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.\n\nI know how to save billions. I saved the taxpayer $#.# billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.\n\nBut I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill. Senator Obama has asked for nearly $# billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nMCCAIN: ... including $# million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown. that is not the way we cut -- we will cut out all the pork.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nOBAMA: Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. It's proposed periodically. It does not happen.\n\nAnd, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that do not work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.\n\nNow, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks. that is one of the centerpieces of his campaign.\n\nEarmarks account for #.# percent of the total federal budget. there is no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it's not going to solve the problem.\n\nNow, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we are doing going forward.\n\nWhen President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $# trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years.\n\nOBAMA: And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.\n\nSo one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.\n\nwe have got to take this in a new direction, that is what I propose as president.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years? You have said previously you thought you could, Senator McCain.\n\nMCCAIN: Sure I do. And let me tell you...\n\nSCHIEFFER: You can still do that?\n\nMCCAIN: Yes. Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. i am going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.\n\nSenator Obama talks about voting for budgets. He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $##,### a year. Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget. It's completely out of control.\n\nThe mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City. they are doing it all over America because they have to. Because they have to balance their budgets. I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...\n\nSCHIEFFER: In four years?\n\nMCCAIN: ... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.\n\nNow, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they are angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.\n\nSenator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for. He voted for the last two budgets that had that $## billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed. He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed. So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama. Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.\n\nI have fought against spending. I have fought against special interests. I have fought for reform. You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Barack.\n\nOBAMA: Well, there is a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it. First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which was not very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party. I support...\n\nMCCAIN: An overwhelming vote.\n\nOBAMA: I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers. does not make me popular with the teachers union. I support clean coal technology. does not make me popular with environmentalists. So i have got a history of reaching across the aisle.\n\nNow with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $##,### a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.\n\nEven FOX News disputes it, and that does not happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.\n\nNow, you have shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you are proposing is eight more years of the same thing. And it has not worked.\n\nAnd I think the American people understand it has not worked. We need to move in a new direction.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right...\n\nMCCAIN: Let me just say, Bob.\n\nSCHIEFFER: OK. About ## seconds.\n\nMCCAIN: OK. But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration. I have disagreed with leaders of my own party. i have got the scars to prove it.\n\nWhether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time. Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights. Whether it be the establishment of the #/## Commission.\n\nI have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nMCCAIN: Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party is not very convincing.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. we are going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign. Both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator Obama, your campaign has used words like erratic, out of touch, lie, angry, losing his bearings to describe Senator McCain.\n\nSenator McCain, your commercials have included words like disrespectful, dangerous, dishonorable, he lied. Your running mate said he palled around with terrorists.\n\nAre each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other's face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?\n\nAnd, Senator McCain, you are first.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, this has been a tough campaign. It's been a very tough campaign. And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least ## of them by now.\n\nWhen Senator Obama was first asked, he said, Any place, any time, the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.\n\nAnd the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.\n\nOne of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- i have written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful.\n\nAnd, Senator Obama, you did not repudiate those remarks. Every time there is been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.\n\nSo I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it. And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you did not keep your word.\n\nAnd when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision, you did not tell the American people the truth because you did not.\n\nAnd that is -- that is -- that is an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up. All right.\n\nOBAMA: Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.\n\nAnd ### percent, John, of your ads -- ### percent of them have been negative.\n\nMCCAIN: It's not true.\n\nOBAMA: It absolutely is true. And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.\n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we are having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. that is the stuff that campaigns should be made of.\n\nThe notion, though, that because we are not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but ###s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I do not mind being attacked for the next three weeks.\n\nWhat the American people cannot afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what is most pressing to them: the economic crisis.\n\nSenator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.\n\nAnd I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college. And that is something that I would welcome. But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, if you will turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.\n\nOBAMA: Congratulations.\n\nMCCAIN: Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. And any objective observer has said it's not true. you are running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research. I do not.\n\nyou are running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration. So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.\n\nAnd of course, i have been talking about the economy. Of course, i have talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that i am not going to spread his wealth around. i am going to let him keep his wealth. And of course, we are talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.\n\nthat is what my campaign is all about and that is what it'll continue to be all about.\n\nBut again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...\n\nOBAMA: I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like terrorist and kill him, and that you are running mate did not mention, did not stop, did not say Hold on a second, that is kind of out of line.\n\nAnd I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.\n\nNow...\n\nMCCAIN: you have got to read what he said...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOBAMA: Let -- let -- let... MCCAIN: you have got to read what he said.\n\nOBAMA: Let me -- let me complete...\n\nSCHIEFFER: Go ahead.\n\nOBAMA: ... my response. I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we do not think that comparison is appropriate.\n\nAnd, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.\n\nThe important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that is what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.\n\nMCCAIN: I cannot...\n\nOBAMA: We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...\n\nMCCAIN: We do and I hope...\n\nOBAMA: ... talking about it this evening.\n\nMCCAIN: Sure.\n\nOBAMA: But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we are not talking about issues. What we are talking about...\n\nMCCAIN: Well, let me just say I would...\n\nSCHIEFFER: (inaudible)\n\nMCCAIN: Let me just say categorically i am proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of ##,###, ##,###, ##,### people, you are going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And i have -- and we have always said that that is not appropriate.\n\nBut to somehow say that group of young women who said Military wives for McCain are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, i am not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they are great citizens.\n\nAnd i am not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there is a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that i am not happy about either.\n\nIn fact, some T-shirts that are very...\n\nOBAMA: John, I...\n\nMCCAIN: ... unacceptable. So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they have been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.\n\nBut the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on. I have not.\n\nOBAMA: Well, look, Bob, as I said...\n\nSCHIEFFER: I mean, do you take issue with that?\n\nOBAMA: You know, here's what I would say. I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns. I suspect we will not agree here tonight.\n\nWhat I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we are facing, if we are going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we are going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we are going to have to be able to work together.\n\nOBAMA: And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable. And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues. What we cannot do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people. And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long. And I think...\n\nMCCAIN: Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Short answer, yes, short answer.\n\nMCCAIN: Yes, real quick. Mr. Ayers, I do not care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.\n\nWe need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $###,### for lighting and site selection. So all of these things need to be examined, of course.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. i am going to let you respond and we will extend this for a moment.\n\nOBAMA: Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- i will respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So let's get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.\n\nForty years ago, when I was # years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.\n\nOther members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.\n\nMr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So that is Mr. Ayers.\n\nNow, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what they have done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there did not really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.\n\nIt had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement i have had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.\n\nNow, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.\n\nLet me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. If i am interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.\n\nThose are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $###,### to ACORN. So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.\n\nOBAMA: that is absolutely not true.\n\nMCCAIN: And the facts are facts and records are records.\n\nOBAMA: And that is not the facts.\n\nMCCAIN: And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in #### said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him. It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.\n\nAnd my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America. And that is what my campaign is about and i am not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy. And that is really what this campaign is going to be about.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's go to the next topic and you -- we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion. I want to ask both of you about the people that you are going to bring into the government. And our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates.\n\nSCHIEFFER: So i will begin by asking both of you this question, and i will ask you to answer first, Senator Obama. Why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate?\n\nOBAMA: Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country. It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.\n\nBut it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.\n\nAnd, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. that is what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.\n\nthat is what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark #### crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act. Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.\n\nBecause after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we are going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we are investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for ## years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.\n\nSo, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin. They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America. She's a reformer. She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor. When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, This cannot go on.\n\nShe's given money back to the taxpayers. She's cut the size of government. She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $## billion pipeline of natural gas that is going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower ##.\n\nShe's a reformer through and through. And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that is been so much a part of it that i have fought against for all these years.\n\nShe'll be my partner. She understands reform. And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families. She understands that autism is on the rise, that we have got to find out what is causing it, and we have got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.\n\nShe understands that better than almost any American that I know. i am proud of her.\n\nAnd she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process. And I cannot tell how proud I am of her and her family.\n\nHer husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think she's qualified to be president?\n\nOBAMA: You know, I think it's -- that is going to be up to the American people. I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.\n\nAnd I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs. I agree with that, John.\n\nI do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we are going to get serious in terms of research. That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.\n\nAnd if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we are not going to be able to do it. that is an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we are funding some of those programs.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think Senator Biden is qualified?\n\nMCCAIN: I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects. But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.\n\nHe voted against the first Gulf War. He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.\n\nIn Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries. we are seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we are seeing them. we are now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.\n\nThere are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I open and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.\n\nBut again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that is the answer -- why do we always have to spend more?\n\nWhy cannot we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government? Maybe that is why he's asked for ### -- sought and proposed $### billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let's go to -- let's go to a new topic. we are running a little behind.\n\nLet's talk about energy and climate control. Every president since Nixon has said what both of you...\n\nMCCAIN: Climate change.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Climate change, yes -- has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n\nWhen Nixon said it, we imported from ## to ## percent of our foreign oil. Now, we are importing more than ## percent.\n\nWould each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term?\n\nAnd I believe the first question goes to you, Senator McCain. MCCAIN: I think we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil. Canadian oil is fine.\n\nBy the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, Yes, and we will sell our oil to China.\n\nYou do not tell countries you are going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.\n\nWe can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building ## new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. We can store and we can reprocess.\n\nSenator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.\n\nLook, we have sailed Navy ships around the world for ## years with nuclear power plants on them. We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.\n\nSo the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that is hurting rather badly.\n\nSo I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we do not achieve our independence.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years?\n\nOBAMA: I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela. I think that is about a realistic timeframe.\n\nAnd this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, we have got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $### billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. It's mortgaging our children's future.\n\nNow, from the start of this campaign, i have identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.\n\nNumber one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the ## million acres that they currently have leased that they are not drilling, use them or lose them.\n\nAnd I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use ## percent of the world's oil, which means that we cannot drill our way out of the problem.\n\nthat is why i have focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that is built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.\n\nWe invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.\n\nOBAMA: Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA does not have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.\n\nAnd what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.\n\nAnd when it comes to South Korea, we have got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. that is all good. We can only get #,### to #,### into South Korea. That is not free trade. we have got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence. And you really have to pay attention to words. He said, we will look at offshore drilling. Did you get that? Look at. We can offshore drill now. we have got to do it now. We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. It's doable. The technology is there and we have to drill now.\n\nNow, on the subject of free trade agreements. I am a free trader. And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.\n\nBut let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes. Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there is a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.\n\nBecause of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country that is helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that is killing young Americans.\n\nAnd also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we have already paid.\n\nFree trade with Colombia is something that is a no-brainer. But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.\n\nOBAMA: Let me respond. Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.\n\nAnd what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence is not being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.\n\nBut I think that the important point is we have got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.\n\nAnd the last point i will make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people cannot get car loans.\n\nthat is why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.\n\nAnd Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about ## percent of our total energy consumption.\n\nIf we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create # million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama does not want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.\n\nFree trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.\n\nSo I do not -- I do not think there is any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes. And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.\n\nwe are not going to follow that path while i am -- when i am president of the United States.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right, let's go to a new topic, health care. Given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage? The question is first to Senator Obama.\n\nOBAMA: we have got to do both, and that is exactly what my plan does.\n\nLook, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-##s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance.\n\nAnd they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they are worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.\n\nSo here's what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you do not have to do anything. If you have got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.\n\nThe only thing we are going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $#,### per year. If you do not have health insurance, then what we are going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.\n\nwe are going to make sure that insurance companies cannot discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. we will negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.\n\nWe are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.\n\nAnd we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. we have got to put more money into preventive care.\n\nThis will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we are going to save the federal budget, because we cannot afford these escalating costs.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nSenator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans. they are seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up. Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.\n\nAnd it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.\n\nWe need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will -- that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics.\n\nThe rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. Every parent should know what is going on there.\n\nWe -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.\n\nBut I want to give every American family a $#,### refundable tax credit. Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.\n\nNow, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there. Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you are a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you are out there, my friend, and you have got employees, and you have got kids, if you do not get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.\n\nMCCAIN: Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I do not think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.\n\nSenator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.\n\nIf you like that, you will love Canada and England. So the point is...\n\nSCHIEFFER: So that is your objective?\n\nOBAMA: It is not and I did not describe it...\n\nMCCAIN: No, you stated it.\n\nOBAMA: I just...\n\nMCCAIN: Excuse me.\n\nOBAMA: I just described what my plan is. And i am happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you are out there. Here's your fine -- zero. You will not pay a fine, because...\n\nMCCAIN: Zero?\n\nOBAMA: Zero, because as I said in our last debate and i will repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.\n\nI exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, we have got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.\n\nRight now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they are going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.\n\nThe average family is paying an additional $### a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.\n\nSo here's what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we will give you a ## percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.\n\nIf you do not have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.\n\nNow, what we have not talked about is Senator McCain's plan. He says he's going to give you all a $#,### tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance.\n\nHere's the problem -- that for about ## million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $#,###, young and healthy folks.\n\nOlder folks, let's healthy folks, what is going to end up happening is that you are going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers will not be able to afford it.\n\nAnd once you are out on your own with this $#,### credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.\n\nAnd this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.\n\nBy the way, the average policy costs about $##,###. So if you have got $#,### and it's going to cost you $##,###, that is a loss for you.\n\nLast point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.\n\nThat, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.\n\nSCHIEFFER: What about that?\n\nMCCAIN: Hey, Joe, you are rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for ##-## hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.\n\nNow, Joe, you are rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you will have to pay a fine if you do not provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.\n\nthat is big government at its best. Now, ## percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $#,### onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.\n\nAnd the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America. The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $#,###. i am going to give them $#,### to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.\n\nThis will give them availability. This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.\n\nThis really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies. If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.\n\nSenator Obama wants government to do the job. I want, Joe, you to do the job.\n\nMCCAIN: I want to leave money in your pocket. I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family. that is what i am all about. And we have got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by ## percent in the last eight years.\n\nWe cannot afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse. Have you noticed, they have been in charge the last two years.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. A short response.\n\nOBAMA: Very briefly. You all just heard my plan. If you have got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it. Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.\n\nthat is the choice you will have is having your employer no longer provide you health care. And do not take my word for it. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally does not support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.\n\nAll I want to do, if you have already got health care, is lower your costs. That includes you, Joe.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right. Let's stop there and go to another question. And this one goes to Senator McCain. Senator McCain, you believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. Senator Obama, you believe it should not.\n\nCould either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on this issue? Senator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: I would never and have never in all the years i have been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court. that is not appropriate to do.\n\nSCHIEFFER: But you do not want Roe v. Wade to be overturned?\n\nMCCAIN: I thought it was a bad decision. I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad. I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states. i am a federalist. And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test. Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up. Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.\n\nWe got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats. You were offered a chance to join. You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, conservative judges.\n\nI voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg. Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated. This is a very important issue we are talking about.\n\nSenator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they did not meet his ideological standards. that is not the way we should judge these nominees. Elections have consequences. They should be judged on their qualifications. And so that is what I will do.\n\nI will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution. And not legislating from the bench.\n\nSCHIEFFER: But even if it was someone -- even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?\n\nMCCAIN: I would consider anyone in their qualifications. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nOBAMA: Well, I think it's true that we should not apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.\n\nAnd it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.\n\nNow I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.\n\nBut what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that should not be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.\n\nOBAMA: So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.\n\ni will just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.\n\nFor years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she did not know about it until fairly recently.\n\nWe tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.\n\nI think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that is the kind of judge that I want.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Time's up.\n\nMCCAIN: Obviously, that law waved the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back ## or ## years. It was a trial lawyer's dream.\n\nLet me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.\n\nSenator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.\n\nAnd then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did ### times as a state senator, he voted present.\n\nThen there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.\n\nI do not know how you vote present on some of that. I do not know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that is his record, and that is a matter of his record.\n\nAnd he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Response?\n\nOBAMA: Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that is because it's not true. The -- here are the facts.\n\nThere was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.\n\nAnd the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.\n\nWith respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there is an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.\n\nAnd I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that is why I voted present, because i am willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.\n\nThe last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that -- look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.\n\nBut there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\n\nThose are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that is where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation.\n\nOBAMA: We should try to reduce these circumstances.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let's give Senator McCain a short response...\n\nMCCAIN: Just again...\n\nSCHIEFFER: ... and then...\n\nMCCAIN: Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama. He's health for the mother. You know, that is been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.\n\nthat is the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, health. But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. we will do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.\n\nBut that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn. Of course, we have to come together. Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we will help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we will help take care of it.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Let's stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and i am afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen.\n\nThe question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education. Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the ##th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world.\n\nThe implications of this are clearly obvious. Some even say it poses a threat to our national security.\n\nDo you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it?\n\nThe question to Senator Obama first.\n\nOBAMA: This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there is never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power. So we have got to get our education system right. Now, typically, what is happened is that there is been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.\n\nIn some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.\n\nI think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.\n\nAnd I think it's important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they are going to college, they are taking on $##,###, $##,###, $##,###, $##,### worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they are going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.\n\nAnd that is why i have proposed a $#,### tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.\n\nIf we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.\n\nBut there is one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that is parents. We cannot do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. they have got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator McCain?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, it's the civil rights issue of the ##st century. there is no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.\n\nBut what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?\n\nSo choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that is already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.\n\nAnd we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice. Charter schools are not the only answer, but they are providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.\n\nNow, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.\n\nSo I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.\n\nMCCAIN: We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.\n\nLook, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools? And I mean, more federal money?\n\nOBAMA: Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that is a tradition that has served us well. But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.\n\nNow we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.\n\nSo what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.\n\nCharter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.\n\nAnd we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they cannot hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.\n\nWhere we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.\n\nRecently his key economic adviser was asked about why he did not seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we cannot give money to every interest group that comes along.\n\nI do not think America's youth are interest groups, I think they are our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We cannot say we are going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we are going to pay for it.\n\nAnd if we are going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. It's not going to happen on its own.\n\nSCHIEFFER: What about that, Senator?\n\nMCCAIN: Well, sure. i am sure you are aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there is a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some #,### parents asked to be eligible for that.\n\nBecause they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had. And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.\n\nAnd we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system. That was vouchers. That was voucher, Senator Obama. And i am frankly surprised you did not pay more attention to that example.\n\nNow as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective. And we need to fix a lot of the problems. We need to sit down and reauthorize it.\n\nBut, again, spending more money is not always the answer. I think the Head Start program is a great program. A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do. By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program are not any better off than the others.\n\nLet's reform it. Let's reform it and fund it. That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats. We need to reform these programs. We need to have transparency. We need to have rewards. It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.\n\nAnd I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And we will find and we will spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And we will care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.\n\nMCCAIN: But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.\n\nAnd I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed. But i am not going to continue to throw money at a problem. And i have got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. And it's been proven.\n\nOBAMA: i will just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C. Senator McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. And we have got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...\n\nMCCAIN: Who supports vouchers.\n\nOBAMA: ... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.\n\nMCCAIN: She supports vouchers, also.\n\nOBAMA: But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data does not show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by #,### slots.\n\nThat leaves all of you who live in the other ## states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.\n\nSo if we are going to be serious about this issue, we have got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on. And that is what I intend to do as president.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nMCCAIN: Because there is not enough vouchers; therefore, we should not do it, even though it's working. I got it.\n\nSCHIEFFER: All right.\n\nGentlemen, we have come to the close. Before I ask both of you for your closing statements tonight, I'd like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to MyDebates.org, where you will find this evening's debates and the three that preceded tonight's debate.\n\nNow, for the final statements, by a coin toss, Senator McCain goes first.\n\nMCCAIN: Well, thank you again, Bob.\n\nThanks to Hofstra.\n\nAnd it's great to be with you again. I think we have had a very healthy discussion.\n\nMy friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America. And they were graphically demonstrated again today.\n\nAmerica needs a new direction. We cannot be satisfied with what we have been doing for the last eight years.\n\nI have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a #/## Commission, I have a long record of it.\n\nAnd i have been a careful steward of your tax dollars. We have to make health care affordable and available. We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.\n\nWe have to stop the spending. We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.\n\nAll of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.\n\nthat is why i have asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.\n\ni have spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first. As a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and i have been proud to serve.\n\nAnd I hope you will give me an opportunity to serve again. I'd be honored and humbled.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator?\n\nOBAMA: Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.\n\nI think we all know America is going through tough times right now. The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nAnd that is why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we have seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.\n\nWe need fundamental change in this country, and that is what I'd like to bring.\n\nYou know, over the last ## months, you have invited me into your homes. you have shared your stories with me. And you have confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.\n\nAnd that is why i am sure that our brighter days are still ahead.\n\nBut we are going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go. In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future. In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.\n\nThese are the policies I have fought for my entire career. And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.\n\nBut it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be quick. It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.\n\ni am absolutely convinced we can do it. I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSCHIEFFER: Senator Obama, Senator McCain, thank you very much.\n\nThis concludes the final debate. i am Bob Schieffer of CBS News, and I will leave you tonight with what my mother always said -- go vote now. It will make you feel big and strong. Good night, everyone.\n\nEND\n\nTranscription by: CQ Transcriptions/Morningside"

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: Tonight on CROSSFIRE, as President Obama prepares to address the nation, he hits the pause button on attacking Syria. Should he follow Russia's lead or keep threatening a military strike?\n\n\n\nJOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: Nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging.\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER: On the left, Van Jones. On the right, S.E. Cupp. In the CROSSFIRE, Joe Lieberman, who supports the strike on Syria, and Rick Santorum, who's opposed. Is Russia's diplomacy real? Or should the U.S. strike Assad now? Tonight on CROSSFIRE.\n\n\n\nVAN JONES, CO-HOST: Welcome to CROSSFIRE. i am Van Jones on the left.\n\n\n\nS.E. CUPP, CO-HOST: i am S.E. Cupp on the right.\n\n\n\nTonight, the world is giddy at the prospect of getting out of a U.S. military strike on Syria. It's all thanks to Russia's offer of a diplomatic solution, even though it's a phony one. Nevertheless, the president's team is more than happy to take credit for it.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nKERRY: Well, it's the credible threat of force that has been on the table for these last weeks that has, for the first time, brought this regime to even acknowledge that they have a chemical weapons arsenal.\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: This is a victory for President Obama, if it is real.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCUPP: Van, it seems like Nancy Pelosi is ready to order the mission accomplished banner. Look, everyone wants to parachute out of this conflict. I get that. But the Russians have offered us not a parachute but a knapsack. A knapsack that will never open. This is nothing more than a delay tactic.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, I disagree. First of all, I think the world is rightfully happy that we are off the path to war, possibly. The diplomatic option is a good thing. And frankly, everybody is giving John Kerry a hard time. I would rather for us to blunder on the path to peace than to stumble onto the path of war.\n\n\n\nCUPP: If this were proposal -- if this proposal were real and offered up by legitimate, good actors, I would be happy to consider it.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, welcome to the real world, where you do not get the chance to pick who offers you a solution to this thing.\n\n\n\nLook, we have got two former presidential candidates and two former senators -- both the same person -- tonight on CROSSFIRE to help us with this thing.\n\n\n\nRICK SANTORUM (R), FORMER PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR: Two friends, I might add. And two friends.\n\n\n\nJONES: And two friends. Republican Rick Santorum is against attacking Syria. Democratic former senator, now independent, Joe Lieberman, he supports the strike.\n\n\n\nThe first question to you. you have got to be happy now. we have got a big diplomatic opening. you have got to be on President Obama's team now. you are happy, right?\n\n\n\nCUPP: Leading question.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: If there is not going to be a military attack, that is a good thing. So if the president is willing to step down for whatever reason, look, he -- he went to the Congress because he did not want to do this. If he wanted to do it, he'd said he had the power to do it. And he just decided not to.\n\n\n\nWhen you consider the fact that, whether it's on immigration or health care or on DOMA or on a whole variety of things --\n\n\n\nJONES: But are you --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- he's done things that he does not have the power to do. Now he has the power to do something, and he went to Congress. So it's clear he did not want to do this.\n\n\n\nJONES: you are on team Obama now.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: i am on team let's not broaden this war and put a much more complicated diplomatic situation and military situation in the hands of someone who's proved incapable of handling the situation.\n\n\n\nJONES: we will argue about that later.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Lieberman, why after two years and ###,### people dead, two chemical attacks, two million refugees, why is pausing yet again to dither on this conflict the smart or moral decision?\n\n\n\nJOE LIEBERMAN (I), FORMER CONNECTICUT SENATOR: Well, I wish we were not pausing. I mean, I think President Obama made the right moral decision when he drew the red line --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- and then when he said, after we had proof that chemical weapons were used to kill almost #,### innocents, including ### children by Assad in Syria, that he was going to take military action.\n\n\n\nI was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress. He was right. He had the legal authority to do it himself. I wish he had done it. If he had, I think the American people would have been happy now that he had done it.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Should he attack now? Should he attack now without Congress?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I -- well, I think, now that Russia has made this offer, even though it's hard to take it seriously coming from Russia which has not been our friend -- just look at the Snowden matter.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Look at Syria, where Assad -- John Kerry said correctly last week that he tried very hard to reach an agreement with Assad years ago as a senator and decided he was a liar.\n\n\n\nJONES: But you are not saying we should through this peace offering in the garbage can and then -- and then attack now. Is that what you are saying?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: No, i am saying that it's hard to take the proposal by Russia seriously, but it's important enough that we have got to challenge them to be serious about it and see if Syria really will, with international supervision and penalties, get rid of all their chemical weapons. If they did that, it would be a tremendous accomplishment.\n\n\n\nBut I think the president still has to face the fact, if nothing happens, that there was a chemical attack --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The bottom line is here we have no national security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: We do not have any national security interests when children are being chemically --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Then we should be in Darfur. Then we should be in ## other countries around the world.\n\n\n\nJONES: Hold on.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That is not --\n\n\n\nCUPP: What about --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That is not a reason.\n\n\n\nCUPP: What about al Qaeda?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I wish -- I wish -- that is the point. The point is we have no set national security interest, because the two sides of this conflict are both enemies of the United States. We have al Qaeda, who is basically the dominant rebel force right now, on one side and we have on the other side Hezbollah, Iran, Russia and Assad. JONES: I do not understand what you want to do, though. Here's my problem. You are a leader on Syria. You are a big supporter and, frankly, the author of the Syrian Accountability Act.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I was.\n\n\n\nJONES: And now you seem to have completely disappeared. What is it that you think that should happen? I want to show you -- show you these images that have shocked the world. Can we show these images?\n\n\n\nLook at these children. they are twitching. they are dying. What if one of the mothers of one of those children called this station right now and said to you, Why will not you help me? Why will not you help my children? you are saying there is no interest in doing that.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The reason the United States -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this. We may disagree on where we come out, but the reason the United States uses military forces for one reason and one reason only. It's in our national security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: We have no moral obligation?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have no moral obligation to use military force when it comes to a humanitarian situation. We have other obligations.\n\n\n\nJONES: Look, what -- but what can we do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We need to get involved. We need to -- the Syrian Accountability Act was about political sanctions. It was about economic sanctions. It was no trip wire for military force. And when the president used the Syrian Accountability Act as reasons for Congress to support him, he misled the American public on that.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: As the author, I know that.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum, I know you. We go back a little ways. we have had some conservations about faith and morality and values, social conservatism. I do not understand -- help me understand -- how you square your conscience with not going in and ending a conflict where hundreds of thousands have died? How -- how are you not concerned that this will become another Rwanda?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: they are fighting for their freedom, incidentally, which is what America's supposed to be all about.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Yes. And how -- are not you worried this will be another Rwanda?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: This did not start out as al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: I agree. And I called for military force ## months ago.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right. As did I. As did I.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I met with the opposition. And there -- these were patriots, Syrian patriots, freedom fighters --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Agreed.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- who were sick of the dictator.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Agreed.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: We held back and al Qaeda came in. I do not think al Qaeda is the dominant force in the opposition. I think from all I know it's the Syrian people who want to change from Assad. And they deserve --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJONES: I want to give him a chance to say something, because listen, I want to double down on peace. I do not want to double down on war. I think that we have diplomatic options we have not exhausted. My quarrel with the president all week long has been we are rushing to war.\n\n\n\nBut my problem is, I want to double down on peace; some people want to double down on war. It seems like you are doubling down on nothing. What do you want us to do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's -- let's --\n\n\n\nJONES: If you were the president, what would you do?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Well, first off, go back and look at the debates that occurred about ## months ago. And I, in those debates, called for the president to intervene, to side with exactly the people that Joe Lieberman was talking about, and get involved, give them --\n\n\n\nJONES: So we had an interest then, but we do not have an interest now?\n\n\n\nHold on a second. How do we have an interest then and not now?\n\n\n\nCUPP: Everything has changed.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Everything has changed. Everything has changed. The people who are the rebels in Syria right now are not the same people that we --\n\n\n\nCUPP: that is right.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: That we could have been partners with ## months ago.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But it's not going to get better if we hang back. I mean, if we get involved in one level and support the moderates there -- and there are moderates there who are our friends -- then they'll have a better opportunity to control the country when Assad goes.\n\n\n\nRight now, I think we have got to hang tough. And tonight, the president's got a real challenge, but -- because of all of the twists and turns of the story -- but he's got a great opportunity to tell people why he thinks it's worth us carrying out limited but decisive attacks. CUPP: What does he need to say tonight? What does he need to say tonight?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Well, I think he needs to say, one, we cannot -- we cannot handle every problem in the world. But Americans, you know, we have a Declaration of Independence that talks about the self-evident truth that everybody -- not just Americans but in the world -- got from our creator the rights to life and liberty. And these people in Syria have been deprived of both of those rights.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But here's the point. If you let a dictator mass murder his people and you turn away from it, he's going to keep going. And every other madman is going to keep going.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Sure. And have not we learned this lesson?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Two different -- two different lessons. First off, there are lot -- there are lots of dictators, unfortunately, in this world who are mass murdering their people. we have seen it. we have seen it under President Obama. We saw it under President Bush. It's under presidents for decades now. The United States has not stepped in unless there is a national security interest military. we have stepped in in other ways, but we have not stepped in militarily.\n\n\n\nBut the president is going to change that and say that humanitarian reasons and the reason we are going to step in and -- and engage in military conflict. We are broadening -- you want to talk about not being a cop on the beat. You want to talk about something you and folks that -- that have been advocating for us to have -- make peace not war. we have now opened up Pandora's box as to military use. It's a bad idea. It's not in the security interests.\n\n\n\nJONES: I want -- I want you to respond to this. My quarrel with the president is I think he did two things right and one thing wrong. I think he was right to say this is an outrage, and we are not going to let babies get gassed.\n\n\n\nCUPP: And then do nothing about it?\n\n\n\nJONES: I think that was right. I think he was wrong to rush into a war posture without talking to Congress, without bringing in the U.N., without bringing a global coalition, without exhausting --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: He did that when he set the red line, with Russia. And he set the red line --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Months ago.\n\n\n\nJONES: And he did -- and I think he did. Because he waited -- and i am surprised you say you wish we'd gone in -- because he waited, we now have a new opening.\n\n\n\nDo you disagree that the president, by putting those warships out there and waiting, do not you agree he created an opening now for peace? you are saying that the president has done nothing right this whole crisis?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: If we believe Putin and Assad are legitimate actors in the diplomatic stage. Well, but that is who's come forward, and it's not --\n\n\n\nCUPP: It's who we got.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It's who we got. And so, look, i am perfectly willing to let this play out. I want us to not strike Syria --\n\n\n\nJONES: You and me both.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- because I think streaking Syria, at this point in time, will create a real problem for us militarily with Russia, with potentially others in the region.\n\n\n\nWe are taking -- and I think Joe will agree with me on this one. The whole Syria conflict at this point, has taken our eye off the ball. And the ball is Iran. Syria is a puppet state of Iran.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: that is exactly the reason why we cannot let Assad get away.\n\n\n\nCUPP: that is right. Iran is watching.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: It's the biggest body blow we could land to Iran. He's their only ally in the Arab world. And this -- even this proposal, which if it works for Russia, will be a good thing. The price of it will be that Assad will stay there, and Iran will still have its No. # ally in the Arab world.\n\n\n\nCUPP: All right. Well, let's -- let's continue this over in the next -- in the next segment. There are a lot of creative solutions that do not involve bombing and killing people apparently.\n\n\n\nYes, there are and we will talk about it when we get back. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nJONES: Welcome back.\n\n\n\nTonight President Obama addresses the nation about Syria. He's hitting the pause button on the military strikes. That gives us time for some creative solutions. And we should keep the warships parked off of there. But what about helping refugees? What about an arms embargo? What about cyber-attacks, what about anything? It's all either war or nothing.\n\n\n\ni am going to ask you: If there were a dome over Syria, so it was not about bomb or do not bomb, what are some of the creative things we could do that do not involve war? How do we win without war?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Unfortunately, if there were a dome over Syria, there was nothing we could do to stop the bloodshed. Because you have got a basically unfair fight here. The government has most of the fire power. Finally, the patriots, the freedom fighter Syrians, have gotten help from outside. But they are still getting decimated. So --\n\n\n\nJONES: This is America. you are saying there is nothing we can do? It's either Tomahawk missiles or nothing? we are the most creative --\n\n\n\nCUPP: But the dome does not exist, Van. The dome is fantasy land. Let's deal with reality.\n\n\n\nJONES: The fact -- let's get with reality. We have someone here --\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Let me say something about the dome. Because the other reason it's gone --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Van Jones Dome.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The dome is unreal, but what that really reminds us of is that their neighbors there -- Israel, Iraq, Jordan -- they are all being -- Lebanon -- they are all being badly affected by what is going on in Syria. Our allies are.\n\n\n\nJONES: This is a crisis in our country, of imagination. How can we get out of this without bombs. You tell us.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: that is why -- that is why Rick Santorum, ## months ago, during the presidential campaign --\n\n\n\nJONES: Today.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: -- said we should be arming the rebels.\n\n\n\nCUPP: that is right.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We should be supporting them militarily. We should be supporting them economically. We should be doing everything --\n\n\n\nJONES: that is all in the past.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We agree --\n\n\n\nJONES: And now we give up. Because we did not do what you wanted so we just give up.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Because a lot of folks -- hello?\n\n\n\nJONES: Hello?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: A lot of folks said no, we had no interest in this.\n\n\n\nJONES: Hey, listen.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Do you admit you were wrong?\n\n\n\nJONES: i will tell you what: i am going to shock you. I think the Democrats were wrong for not taking Syria more seriously earlier. But I think it's wrong, and i am giving you an opportunity. I do not want to go to war. I think there are a lot of things we could do that would get us out of the situation without war. You are somebody who's got some ideas about it, but I do not hear anybody talking about what can we do.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator, you have said Assad -- Assad has to go. you have said Assad has to go. How do you do it without military intervention?\n\n\n\nJONES: What can we do?\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: This is very difficult right now. When you look at the rebels and the composition of the rebel forces, you see -- you are seeing on YouTube how rebel forces are, you know -- these radical al- Qaeda folks are killing off other rebel leaders and are doing atrocities to the public also.\n\n\n\nJONES: But if you were president --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: You are going to say we are going to come on the side of them and help them.\n\n\n\nJONES: that is terrible. Help us.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: But we cannot. No, what we have to do is do what we should have done from the very beginning, which is let's identify, as we can, and support and protect and defend the legitimate elements within the rebel forces. Begin the process of arming them, protecting them, et cetera.\n\n\n\nJONES: You agree with this?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I totally agree. I just want to say something. you have been using the word war. Nobody's talking about war. President Obama's not talking about war. He's not talking about any American boots on the ground. He's talking about limited, decisive attacks.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Because you are not that naive, Senator Lieberman. You know that, even though President Obama is saying no boots on the ground, if one of our planes goes down, we are sending boots on the ground.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Yes, but that -- everybody's --\n\n\n\nCUPP: This is a lot bigger conflict than he thinks.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: I do not believe so. It's not going to be a massive land invasion.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, what the president could have done when he decided to send it to Congress in taking the military action limited that he has in mind, is not a precedent. President Reagan did it in Grenada and struck at Libya when he thought the Libyans blew up a disco in Germany.\n\n\n\nYou know, President Clinton went into Bosnia, and people could argue we had no national security interests there, but a lot of people were getting slaughtered --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Right.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: -- by the Serbs at that point. And it goes on and on. So --\n\n\n\nJONES: i am glad the president went to Congress. I think the president going to Congress is the best thing that happened, because it gave us time. You do not agree with me.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: No. Here's my concern when he did it. I do not think he had to do it. He himself said, and I think he was right, that he had the legal authority to take action himself as commander in chief under the War Powers Resolution, everything else. He took an enormous risk, and unfortunately, he's in a quagmire now, because the risk was that Congress would say no.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, now they are both being delayed, and the U.N. is -- the U.N. is now a forum where -- I do not understand why you can say it's a bad thing. The delay gave us time.\n\n\n\nCUPP: do not worry. The U.N.'s on it.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: You may have not seen the polls. i am not a great poll- watcher. But the American public is overwhelmingly against the president. The president's been making this case now for several weeks. They are against military action. They do not see any positive benefit for the United States in getting involved in a war between two radical elements of which neither are our friends.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Now I want to -- I want to quote you -- i am quoting from the New Testament, Corinthians: When the sound of the trumpet is uncertain, who will follow into battle? So I think people are so confused about what is going on here. If --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: The president says he has to do it, but then he goes to Congress.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: If you looked at the polls earlier, there was authority for a limited strike without American boots on the ground, particularly if we had some support from other --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Let me ask you, Senator -- go ahead.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Here's the president says we need to do it, but i am going to ask Congress. We need to strike, but it's not going to be decisive. Of course, the American people is going to say what the heck are we doing here?\n\n\n\nBecause here's the problem: If we actually do act, and if the Russians or the Iranians or somebody else say, You know what? you have drawn a line in the sand for us and we are going to -- we are going to act back, now we have put the United States in a much broader war with a president who is clearly over his head.\n\n\n\nJONES: Listen, I do not -- I do not agree the president is in over his head. First of all, let's be clear. This is a president who built a -- he built a coalition to --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Really?\n\n\n\nJONES: Let me finish. He isolated Iran.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: A coalition?\n\n\n\nJONES: Let's walk through the list before we take him down too hard. He got -- he got Russia and China to be with us against Iran.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Stop right there. Stop. Whoa!\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Forget Libya.\n\n\n\nJONES: Libya.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Stop at Iran. Is Iran pursuing the nuclear weapons program? They have not drawn down.\n\n\n\nJONES: The answer is -- Do you want a war? Do you want a war?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have drawn a red line.\n\n\n\nJONES: Yes. we are doing cyber-attacks. we are doing an embargo.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: We have drawn a red line with Iran, and we have done nothing publicly.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Let me ask you. This is a very good opportunity --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCUPP: This is a very good opportunity -- very good opportunity to talk about the U.N. The U.N. -- no one, maybe except Van, trusts the Russians in this new plan to seize chemical weapons from Assad. But I fear that a lot of people trust the U.N. to do that.\n\n\n\nThe U.N. does not have a terribly impressive track record when it comes to ending conflicts. Are you worried? Should the American people trust U.N. to oversee this new Russian plan?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The U.N. works sometimes. Other times it does not. The record is mixed. The question is what passes in the U.N.? If, as France --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Well, nothing if you are Russia and China.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: France tabled a resolution in the Security Council today that basically embraced the Russian proposal that the Syrians get rid of their chemical weapons with international supervision and said that, if they did not, then force was authorized by the U.N. Security Council. I thought that was great, because it called -- called Russia's bluff.\n\n\n\nAnd what do you think Russia did? They said that was unacceptable. They do not want a mandatory resolution with teeth in it. They want it to be a presidential statement of kind of appealing to Syria.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Senator Santorum, do you trust the U.N.?\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It calls into question Russia's credibility with this entire proposal.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Do you trust -- wait, let me ask. Do you trust the U.N.?\n\n\n\nJONES: Hold on.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Pick an issue. The answer is no.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Exactly right.\n\n\n\nJONES: A hundred and seventy-two successful peacekeeping missions and negotiations for some. Listen, we always focus -- ### --\n\n\n\nCUPP: Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Bosnia --\n\n\n\nJONES: The world is a tough, nasty place, and we focus on the places the U.N. has not been able to change human nature. But we are in a much safer world because of the U.N. than we would be without it.\n\n\n\nCUPP: That is not -- that is a total inaccuracy.\n\n\n\nJONES: Look right here: ### peacekeeping --\n\n\n\nCUPP: I have a list, too, of atrocities that they have taken responsibility for and not changed. The world feels very good about itself when it allows the U.N. to take over, because it feels like it's doing something. It's false security.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, listen -- Here's what I do not understand. When George W. Bush brought in the United Nations, people thought that was a good thing. He was trying to bring in the global community. I thought that you wanted us to build a big global coalition. I think we have a moment now to do so.\n\n\n\nAnd why do we have it? We have it for two reasons. One, he went to Congress, which you do not like. And two, because as much as we do not trust the Russians for their own interests, they are moving. Why are you mad at Congress and the U.N.?\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Name -- name the countries that are for the United States getting involved militarily in Syria.\n\n\n\nJONES: Well, apparently, there is France. Militarily?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The people that want us to --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJONES: You can answer that.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: there is about ## that signed that statement calling for action.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Action but not military action.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But you know what? The president has --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: there is a big difference between action and military action. i am for action. i am just not for -- i am not for a military strike. Particularly one that is not decisive and is not going to accomplish anything.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But here's the problem. I think a military strike today will hurt Assad. I think that is the reason why, at least in words, he's accepted this Russian proposal.\n\n\n\nI do not believe him for a minute. i will believe it when I see it, when he gives us his chemical weapons.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's play it out.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: But I think he's scared of a strike. we are going to hit his command and control.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Let's play it out. We strike Assad. We -- we knock out a few command and control operations. Then where do we go?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Then we give more support to the Syrian opposition. Because they will have a tremendous boost in morale.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Why cannot we do that without striking?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: We can, but we have got to strike him because he used chemical weapons. And if we do not, then he'll use them again.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: And you do not have any -- you do not have any fear or concern that any other country will, as a result of us striking Syria, do something to -- to insert themselves even in that conflict or potentially against the United States?\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: They might but you know, when you are -- we cannot -- we cannot act out of fear of what might happen. we are strong. we are still the strongest country in the world.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: we are not. we are not acting like -- we are not acting like a leader. we are not acting strong. we are acting like someone who said, do not knock this off my shoulder and you do. And so I -- OK, so i have got a fight back. We have to have --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: The shoulder was the high moral ground about --\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: It was not a high moral ground.\n\n\n\nLIEBERMAN: Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Assad have used chemical weapons.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Chemical weapons -- LIEBERMAN: you have got to say no.\n\n\n\nSANTORUM: Chemical weapons is very different than WMD that Iran is working on. that is where we should focus our attention.\n\n\n\nCUPP: OK. Thanks to Joe Lieberman and Rick Santorum. It was a great debate. We appreciate it.\n\n\n\nNext, we Cease Fire. there is something important here we need to agree on. Not just the two of us but the whole country.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nJONES: Tonight on CROSSFIRE, we have been debating and fighting about what to do about Syria. But now we are going to call a Cease Fire.\n\n\n\nNow I think, and I want to come back to a point I made. I think that I have to admit that you guys have been right about something. You guys have been out, you in particular, out there for two years saying we have got to do something about Syria, something about Syria.\n\n\n\nI hate your solution.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Yes.\n\n\n\nJONES: I do not like the war. But you are pointing to the right problem. And I think a lot of people on the left were ducking it, and we were not dealing with it. And I think that what my lesson out of this is, even when we do not agree, we have got to listen to each other more than we did.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Well, and I appreciate that. And I will return a favor and say, look, I do not agree with your solutions either, but at least you have been consistent. I think a lot of Democrats and liberals have talked about President Obama's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to President Bush's. And you hold Obama to the same standard as you hold President Bush, and that -- that says a lot about your credibility.\n\n\n\nJONES: Here we go. The two of us, we agreed, and the world did not come to an end.\n\n\n\nCUPP: Here's another thing we agree on: Your opinion matters. You can weigh in on our Fire Back question via Facebook or Twitter. Should the U.S. trust Russia's offer to rid Syria of chemical weapons? Right now ## percent of you say yes; ## percent say no.\n\n\n\nJONES: The debate continues online at CNN.com/crossfire. You can also go to Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\n\nFrom the left, i am Van Jones.\n\n\n\nCUPP: and from the right, i am S.C. Cupp. Join us tomorrow for another edition of CROSSFIRE.\n\n\n\nA special edition of ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT starts right now.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "In his press conference on March ##, ####, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump.\n\n\n\nWe need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas, he said. Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since ####. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t match up with reality,\n\n\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn\u2019t shut down oil production -- that last year, American oil production reached its highest level since ####.\n\n\n\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said oil production, we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\n\n\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to ####:\n\n\n\n####: #,###,###,###\n\n####: #,###,###,###\n\n####: #,###,###,###\n\n####: #,###,###,###\n\n####: #,###,###,###\n\n####: #,###,###,###\n\n####: #,###,###,###\n\n####: #,###,###,###\n\n\n\nSo, #### is definitely the highest since ####. But we\u2019ll note a couple of caveats.\n\n\n\nFirst, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing #### and #### statistics, petroleum production only rose about # percent. And the level for #### is only ## percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.\n\n\n\nThe second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.\n\n\n\nDomestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by ###,### barrels a day in #### and by an additional ###,### barrels per day in ####. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower ## states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.\n\n\n\nSo Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since ####, but we\u2019re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u0097 Even though federal health officials have begun a criminal investigation into whether the Peanut Corporation of America deliberately sold contaminated products, the government still needed the company\u2019s permission last week before announcing a huge recall of its products.\n\nThe wording of the recall statement had to be approved by the company before the Food and Drug Administration could publish it under current rules. The agency relies on cooperation from food makers to ensure the safety of the food supply even when those makers are suspected of crimes.\n\nSome Democrats in Congress have vowed to change this by giving the F.D.A. more authority, and the agency\u2019s critics say it is too timid with the power it has.\n\nOn Monday, President Obama promised a \u201ccomplete review of F.D.A. operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the F.D.A. has not been able to catch some of these things as quickly as I expect them to catch,\u201d Mr. Obama said in an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show."
